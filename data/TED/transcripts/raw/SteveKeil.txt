 <unk> i 'm here today to start a revolution <unk> now before you get up in arms or you break into song or you pick a favorite color <unk> i want to define what i mean <unk> i mean a drastic and far reaching change in the way we think and behave the way we think and the way we behave <unk>  now why steve <unk> why do we need a revolution <unk> we need a revolution because things aren 't working they 're just not working <unk> and that makes me really sad because i 'm sick and tired of things not working <unk> you know i 'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential i 'm sick and tired of us being last  and we are last place in so many things for example  social factors <unk> we 're last place in europe in innovation  there we are right at the end right at the bottom last place as a culture that doesn 't value innovation we 're last place in health care and that 's important for a sense of <unk> there we are not just last in the e u we 're last in europe at the very bottom <unk>  and worst of all it just came out three weeks ago many of you have seen it the economist we 're the saddest place on earth <unk> relative to gdp per capita the saddest place on earth  that 's social let 's look at education where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the oecd last in reading math and science <unk> lowest perception in the e u that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society  why as a result what happens <unk> the lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses <unk>  and this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies we hire the most people <unk> we create the most taxes <unk>  so if our engine 's broken <unk> guess what last in europe gdp per capita  last <unk> so it 's no surprise guys that sixty two percent of bulgarians are not optimistic about the future <unk> we 're unhappy we have bad education and we have the worst businesses <unk> and these are facts guys this isn 't story tale it 's not make believe it 's not it 's not a conspiracy i have got against bulgaria <unk> these are facts so i think it should be really really clear that our system is broken <unk> the way we think the way we behave our operating system of behaving is broken we need a drastic change in the way <unk> <unk> we think and behave to transform bulgaria for the better for ourselves for our friends for our family and for our future how did this happen let because we don 't value play <unk>  i said play all right in case some of you forgot what play is this is what play looks like babies play <unk>  kids play adults play we don 't value play in fact we devalue play  and we devalue it in three areas let 's go back to the same three areas social <unk> state over the individual and squashing inadvertently creativity <unk> individual <unk> self expression and innovation  and instead what do we value because it 's shown the way we apply generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context which told us what in communism to <unk> i can 't tell you how many times i 've been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground  heaven forbid they play in the dirt the kal or even worse lokvi <unk> water that will kill them i have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn 't let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life  we have a serious meme running through it 's a social gene running through us it 's a serious gene it 's forty five years of it that 's created what i call the <unk> baba factor  and here 's how it works step one woman says i want to have a baby iskam baby step two we get the baby <unk> woohoo <unk> but then what happens in step three <unk> i want to go back to work because i need to further my career or i just want to go have coffees i 'm going to give bebko to baba <unk>  but we need to remember that baba 's been infected by the serious meme for for forty five years  so what happens she passes that virus on to baby and it takes a really really really long time as the redwood trees <unk> that serious meme to get out of our operating system  what happens then it goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for one hundred years <unk> that values rote learning memorization and standardization and devalues <unk> questioning creativity <unk> it 's a crap system true story i went looking for a school for my kid <unk> we went to this prestigious little school and they say they 're going to study math ten times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff <unk> and we said well what about play and recess  and they said ha <unk> there won 't be a single moment in the schedule  and we said he 's five what a crime <unk> what a crime and it 's a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we 're creating mindless robotic workers to put bolts in pre drilled holes but i 'm sorry <unk> the problems of today are not the problems of the industrial revolution <unk> we need adaptability the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative we don 't <unk> qualities of a bulgarian work autocratic do what i say because i 'm the chef i 'm the boss and i know better than you untrusting you 're obviously a criminal so i 'm going to install cameras  controlling you 're obviously an idiot so i 'm going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don 't step out of the box so they 're restrictive don 't use your mobile phone don 't use your laptop don 't search the internet <unk> don 't be on i m that 's somehow unprofessional and bad and at the end of the day it 's unfulfilling because you 're controlled you 're restricted you 're not valued and you 're not having any fun  in social in education and in our business don 't value play and that 's why we 're last because we don 't value play  and you can say that 's ridiculous steve <unk> what a dumb idea it can 't be because of play <unk> we have the serious meme in us <unk> well i 'm going to say no and i will prove it to you in the next part of the speech that play is the catalyst it is the revolution that we can use to transform bulgaria for the better  play <unk> our brains are hardwired for play <unk> evolution has selected over millions and billions of years for play in animals and in humans and you know what <unk> evolution does a really really good job of deselecting traits that aren 't advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage nature isn 't stupid <unk> and it selected for play <unk> throughout the animal kingdom for example ants <unk>  ants play <unk> <unk> when they 're playing they 're learning the social order and dynamics of things rats play <unk> but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better skills  kittens play <unk> we all know kittens play <unk> but what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially they can still <unk> but they can 't be social  bears play <unk>  but what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer <unk> it 's not the bears that learn how to fish better it 's the ones that play more  and a final really interesting study it 's been shown a correlation between play and brain size <unk> the more you play the bigger the brains there are dolphins pretty big brains play a <unk> but who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players <unk>  yours truly humans  kids play we play of every nationality of every race of every color of every religion it 's a universal thing we play <unk>  and it 's not just kids it 's adults too really cool term neoteny the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults and who are the <unk> we play sports we do it for fun <unk> or as olympians or as professionals we play musical instruments we dance we kiss we sing we just goof around <unk>  we 're designed by nature to play from birth to old age <unk> we 're designed to do that continuously to play and play a lot and not stop playing <unk> it <unk> a huge benefit  just like there 's benefits to animals there 's benefits to humans  for example <unk> it 's been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala in the area where it controls emotions it 's been shown to promote pre frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening  as a result what happens we develop more emotional maturity if we play more <unk> we develop better decision making ability if we <unk> the benefits to play it is a genetic birthright that we have like walking or speaking or seeing <unk>  and if we handicap ourselves with play <unk> we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have <unk> we hold ourselves back  little exercise just for a second close your eyes and <unk> try to imagine a world without play <unk> imagine a world without theater without the arts without song without dancing <unk> without soccer without football without laughter <unk>  what does this world look like it 's pretty bleak it 's pretty glum now imagine your workplace is it fun is it playful <unk> or maybe the workplace of your friends here we 're forward thinking is it fun is it playful <unk> or is it crap is it autocratic <unk> controlling restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling <unk>  we have this concept that the opposite of play is work <unk>  we even feel guilty if we 're seen playing at work oh my colleagues see me laughing i must not have enough work or oh i 've got to hide because my boss might see me 's going to think i 'm not working hard <unk> but i have news for you our thinking is backwards <unk>  the opposite of play is not work <unk> the opposite of play is depression <unk>  it 's depression in fact play improves our work just like there 's benefits for <unk> humans and animals there 's benefits for play at work for example it stimulates creativity  it increases our openness to change  it improves our ability to learn it provides a sense of purpose and mastery two key motivational things that increase productivity <unk>  through play so before you start thinking of play as just not serious play doesn 't mean frivolous you know the professional athlete that loves skiing he 's serious about it but he loves it he 's having fun <unk> 's in the groove he 's in the flow a doctor might be serious but laughter 's still a great medicine  our thinking is backwards <unk> we shouldn 't be feeling guilty we should be celebrating play <unk>  quick example from the corporate world fedex easy motto people service profit if you treat your people <unk> sense of mastery and purpose what happens they give better service not worse but better and when customers call for service and they 're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled how do the customers feel  they feel great and what do great customers do great feeling customers they buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends which leads to more profit  people service profit play increases productivity not decreases and you 're going to say <unk> gee that can work for fedex out there in the united states but it can 't work in bulgaria <unk>  no way we 're different  it does work in bulgaria you guys two reasons one play is universal there 's nothing weird about bulgarians that we can 't play <unk> besides the serious meme that we have to kick out two i 've tried it i 've tried at sciant when i got there we had zero happy customers <unk> not one customer would refer us i asked them all  we had marginal profit i did <unk> we had marginal profits and we had unhappy stakeholders  through some basic change change like improving transparency  change like promoting <unk> self direction and collaboration encouraging collaboration not autocracy  the things like having a results focus i don 't care when you get in in the morning <unk> i don 't care when you leave i care that your customer and your team is happy and you 're organized with that why do i care if you get in at nine o 'clock <unk>  basically promoting fun <unk> through promoting fun and a great environment we were able to transform sciant and in just three short years sounds like a long time but change is slow every customer from zero to every customer referring us above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders one of the rankings for best employer for small business <unk> independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys <unk> it does <unk> and it can work in bulgaria there 's nothing holding us back except our own mentality about play so some steps that we can take to finish up how to make this revolution through play <unk> first of <unk> have to believe me if you don 't believe me <unk> well just go home and think about it some more or something  second of all if you don 't have the feeling of play in you you need to rediscover play whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy that you enjoyed only six months ago but now that you 've <unk> <unk> got that promotion you can 't enjoy <unk> because you feel like you have to be serious rediscover it i don 't <unk> to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution you guys have to and if you 're not feeling it your colleagues your employees aren 't going to feel it  you 've got to go back and say hey i 'm going to trust you weird concept i hired you i should trust you i 'm going to let you make decisions i 'm going to empower you and i 'm going to delegate <unk> the lowest level rather than the top i 'm going to encourage constructive criticism  i 'm going to let you challenge authority because it 's by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we 're in and create innovative solutions to problems of today  we 're not always right as leaders <unk> we 're going to eradicate fear fear is the enemy of play and we 're going to do things <unk> eliminate restrictions you know what let them use their mobile phone for personal calls heaven forbid <unk> let them be on the internet <unk> let them be on instant messengers <unk> let them take long lunches  lunch is like the recess for work <unk> it 's when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain you meet your friends <unk> you have a beer you have some food you talk <unk> you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn 't have had before <unk> let them do it  give them some freedom and in general <unk> let them play let them have fun at the workplace we spend so much of our lives at the workplace and it 's supposed to be what a miserable grind <unk> so that twenty years from now we wake up and say is this it is that all there was unacceptable nepriemliv  <unk> so in summary <unk> we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave <unk> but we don 't need a workers ' revolution <unk> we don 't need a workers ' revolution <unk> what we need is a players <unk> ' uprising <unk>  what we need is a players <unk> ' uprising <unk> what we need is a players ' uprising seriously we need to band together today is the start of the uprising but what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution <unk> you need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked about reinvigorating our lives our schools and our work with play <unk>  about how play promotes a sense of promise and self fulfillment of how play promotes innovation and productivity and <unk> how play creates meaning  because we can 't do it alone we have to do it together and together if we do this and share these ideas on play <unk> we can transform bulgaria for the better
