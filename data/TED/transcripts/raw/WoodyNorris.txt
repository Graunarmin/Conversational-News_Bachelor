 <unk> was working at the university of washington and i came up with an idea <unk> from reading a magazine article for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm now that was before cassette tapes c d s dvds any of the cool stuff we 've got now <unk>  and it was an arm that instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record went straight a radial linear tracking tone arm <unk>  and it was the hardest invention i ever made <unk> but it got me started <unk> and i got really lucky after that and without giving you too much of a tirade i want to talk to you about an invention i brought with me today <unk> my 44th invention no that 's not true either <unk> golly i 'm just totally losing it my 44th patent about the 15th invention i call this hypersonic sound i 'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes but i want to make an analogy before i do to this <unk> i usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say that 's really cool but what 's it good for and i say <unk> what is the light bulb good for sound light i 'm going to draw the analogy  when edison invented the light bulb pretty much looked like this hasn 't changed that much  light came out of it in every direction  before the light bulb was invented people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it <unk>  focus it a little bit put lenses in front of it <unk> focus it a little bit better <unk> ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers that were totally focused <unk> now think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb <unk>  but you couldn 't focus light <unk> if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to  that 's the way loudspeakers pretty much are you turn on the loudspeaker <unk> and after almost eighty years <unk> of having those gadgets  the sound just kind of goes where it wants even when you 're standing in front of a megaphone it 's pretty much every direction a little bit of differential but not much  if the light bulb was the way the speaker is and you couldn 't focus or sharpen the edges or define it <unk> we wouldn 't have that  or movies in general <unk> sets <unk> or c d s or dvds and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light <unk>  now <unk> after almost eighty years of having sound <unk>  i thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to <unk> i have a couple of units <unk> that guy there was made for a demo i did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in detroit who wants to put them in a car small version over your head so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car  what if i could aim sound the way i aim light <unk>  i got this waterfall i recorded in my back yard now you 're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you maybe if i hit <unk> sound is being made right next to your ears is that cool  applause because i have some limited time i 'll cut it off for a second and tell you about how it works and what it 's good for  course like light it 's great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack or the cornflakes or the toothpaste or a talking plaque in a <unk> movie theater lobby <unk> sony 's got an idea sony 's our biggest customers right now <unk> they tried this back in the ' 60s and were too smart and so they gave up but they want to use it seriously there 's a mix an inventor has to have you have to be kind of smart <unk>  and though i did not graduate from college doesn 't mean i 'm stupid because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today too many other smart people out there so <unk> just happened to get my education in a little different way i 'm not at all against education i think it 's wonderful i think sometimes people when they get educated lose it <unk> they get so smart they 're unwilling to look at things that they know better than  and we 're living in a great time right now because almost everything 's being explored anew <unk>  i have this little slogan that i use a lot which is and i mean this honestly has been invented yet <unk>  we 're just starting we 're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics and this is i hope a little piece of it <unk>  sony 's got this vision back to get myself on track that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket you 're going to watch a <unk> they know that when you watch t v at home because there are so many choices you can change channels <unk> miss their commercials  a hundred and fifty one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket <unk>  now they 've tried this a couple years ago and it failed because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every twenty minutes <unk>  and reaches out turns off the sound and you know if the sound isn 't there the sale typically isn 't made  <unk> 're on an airplane they show the movie you get to watch it for free when you want to hear the sound you pay <unk>  and so abc and sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket initially it 'll be safeways <unk> it is safeways they 're trying this in three parts of the country right now you 'll be watching tv <unk>  and hopefully they 'll be sensitive that they don 't want to offend you with just one more outlet but what 's great about it <unk> from the tests that have been done is if you don 't want to hear it you take about <unk> one step to the side and you don 't hear it so we create silence as much as we create sound atms that talk to you nobody else hears it <unk>  sit in bed two in the morning watch tv your spouse <unk> or someone is next to you asleep doesn 't hear it doesn 't wake up we 're also working on noise canceling canceling things like snoring noise from automobiles been really lucky with this technology all of a sudden as it is ready the world is ready to accept it <unk>  they have literally beat a path to our door we 've been selling it since about last september october <unk>  and it 's been immensely gratifying if you 're interested in what it costs i 'm not selling them today but this unit with the electronics and everything if you buy one is around a thousand bucks <unk>  we expect by this time next year <unk> hundred bucks to buy it <unk> it 's not any more pricey than regular electronics now when i played it for you you didn 't hear the thunderous bass  this unit that i played goes from about two hundred hertz to above the range of hearing  it 's actually emitting ultrasound low level ultrasound that 's about one hundred thousand vibrations per second <unk>  and the sound that you 're hearing unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is <unk> made on the face is made out in front of it in the air  the air is not linear as we 've always been taught <unk> you turn up the volume just a little bit i 'm talking about a little over eighty decibels and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate here 's why <unk>  the speed of sound is not a constant it 's fairly slow <unk> it changes with temperature and with barometric pressure <unk> now imagine if you will without getting too technical <unk> i 'm making a little sine wave here in the air well if i turn up the amplitude too much <unk> i 'm having an effect on the pressure <unk>  which means during the making of that sine wave the speed at which it is propagating is shifting all of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more <unk> perfectly linear <unk> linearity means higher quality sound  hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite <unk> it 's one hundred percent based on an effect happens in the air <unk> it 's a corrupting effect of the sound the ultrasound in this case that 's emitted  but it 's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect now <unk> the question is where 's the sound made instead of being made on the face of the cone <unk> it 's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air <unk> and so when i aim it towards you what you hear is made right next to <unk> i said we can shorten the column we can spread it out to cover the couch <unk>  i can put it so that one ear hears one speaker the other ear hears the other  that 's true binaural sound <unk> when you listen to stereo on your home system  your both ears hear both speakers <unk> turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you 're hearing it also in your right ear so the stage is more restricted <unk> the sound stage that 's supposed to spread out in front of you  because the sound is made in the air along this column <unk> it does not follow the inverse square law which says it drops off about two thirds every time you double the distance every time you go from one meter for instance to two meters <unk>  that means you go to a rock concert or a symphony <unk> and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row now <unk> we 've been as i say very successful very lucky in having companies catch the vision of this from cars car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids and a separate system in the back oh no the kids aren 't driving today  i was seeing if you were listening actually i haven 't had breakfast yet  a stereo system in the front for mom and dad <unk> and maybe there 's a little dvd player in the back for the kids <unk> don 't want to be bothered with that or their rap music or whatever so again this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on  it also works for transmitting and communicating data <unk>  it also works five times better underwater <unk>  we 've got the military have just deployed some of these into iraq where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some biblical verse  and they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance <unk>  and see a fraction of a degree kelvin in temperature shift from one hundred yards away when they play this thing <unk> so another way of hopefully determining who 's friendly and who isn 't  we make a version with this which puts out one hundred and fifty five decibels <unk> pain is one hundred and twenty  so it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people and there can be a public beach just off to the side and they don 't even know it 's turned on <unk> we sell those to the military presently for about seventy thousand dollars <unk> and they 're buying them as fast as we can make them <unk> we put it on a turret with a camera so that when they shoot at you you 're over there and it 's there <unk>  i have a bunch of other inventions i invented a plasma antenna to shift gears <unk>  looked up at the ceiling of my office one day i was working on a ground penetrating radar project and my physicist ceo came in and said we have a real problem we 're using very short wavelengths we 've got a problem with the antenna ringing  when you run very short wavelengths like a tuning fork the antenna resonates <unk> and there 's more energy coming out of the antenna than there is the backscatter from the ground that we 're trying to analyze taking too much processing  i says why don 't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it <unk>  turn it on turn it off that 's a fluorescent tube <unk> refined  i just sold that for a million and a half dollars cash <unk> i took it back to the pentagon after it got declassified when the patent issued  and told the people back there about it and they laughed and then i took them back a demo and they bought  any of you ever wore a jabber headphone the little cell headphones <unk> that 's my invention i sold that for seven million dollars big mistake it just sold for eighty million dollars two years ago <unk> i actually drew that up on a little crummy mac computer in my attic at my house and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design i drew way back when  so i 've been really lucky as an inventor <unk> i 'm the happiest guy you 're ever going to meet  and my dad died before he realized anybody in the <unk> would maybe hopefully make something out of themselves <unk> you 've been a great audience i know i 've jumped all over the place i usually figure out what my talk is when i get up in front of a group
