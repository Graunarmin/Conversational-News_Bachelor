 <unk> i convinced one of the largest toy companies toymakers in the world hasbro to change the way that they marketed one of their most <unk> best selling products <unk> i have a brother gavin when this whole shebang happened he was four he loved to cook he was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these needless to say uneatable concoctions or making invisible macaroni and cheese he wanted to be a chef really badly <unk>  and so what better gift for a kid who wanted to be a chef than an easy bake oven <unk> right <unk> i mean we all had those when we were little  and he wanted one so badly <unk> but then he <unk> started to realize something  in the commercials <unk> and on the boxes for the easy bake ovens hasbro marketed them specifically to girls and the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials <unk> and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens and would be in bright pink and purple very <unk> <unk> gender specific colors <unk> was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook boys aren 't  and this discouraged my brother a lot he thought that he wasn 't supposed to want to be a chef because that was something that girls did girls cooked boys didn 't or so was the message that hasbro was sending and this got me thinking god i wish there was a way that i could change this that could i have my voice heard by hasbro so i could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it <unk> and that got me thinking about a website that i had learned about a few months prior called <unk> is an online petition sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks through facebook through twitter through youtube through reddit through tumblr through whatever you can think of  and so i created a petition along with the youtube video that i added to the petition basically asking hasbro <unk> to change the way that they marketed it in featuring boys in the commercials on the boxes and most of all creating them in less <unk> gender specific colors  so this petition started to take off <unk> fast you have no idea i was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets <unk> needless to say it was crazy <unk> eventually hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new easy bake oven product to me in black silver and blue it was literally one of the best moments <unk> my life it was like willy wonka and the chocolate factory that thing was amazing  what i didn 't realize at the time however was that i had become an activist  i could change something that even as a kid or maybe even especially as a kid my voice mattered  and your voice matters too i want to let you know it 's not going to be easy and it wasn 't easy for me because i faced <unk> sometimes even in real life were disrespectful to me and my family and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time and it really discouraged me and actually i have some examples because what 's better revenge than displaying their idiocy <unk> so let 's see from user name <unk> interesting user names we have here disgusting <unk> shut up you just want money and attention so it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because i thought people don 't care people think it 's a waste of <unk> time <unk>  and people are going to be disrespectful to me and my family it hurt me and it made me think what 's the point of making change in the future  but then i started to realize something <unk> haters gonna hate <unk>  come on say it with me one two three haters gonna hate <unk>  so let your haters hate you know what and make your change because i know you can out into this crowd <unk> and i see four hundred people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change and i know that you can and all of you watching at home can too because you have so <unk> much that you can do and that you believe in and you can trade it across all these social media through facebook through twitter through youtube through reddit through tumblr through whatever else you can think of  <unk> change it and that spark that you 've been hearing about all day today you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire <unk> thank you
