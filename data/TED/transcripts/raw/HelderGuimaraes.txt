 <unk> like to start my performance by saying ninety percent of everything is crap  it 's called sturgeon 's law and what that means is that the majority of anything is always bad <unk> have a giraffe here <unk> i 'm going to throw the giraffe behind my back and whoever catches it is going to help me on this next thing <unk>  sir <unk> you caught the giraffe <unk> i have a playing card in my hand <unk>  freely name any card in the deck audience member ten of <unk> you could have named any card in the deck but you said the ten of hearts <unk> ninety percent of everything is crap so there 's this to prove that sturgeon was correct <unk> keep the giraffe for a moment okay <unk>  jesus  crazy people well  the truth is  why is the majority of everything bad and my answer is i think we stop thinking too soon <unk>  i 'll give you a clear little example something that <unk> people used to do around the turn of the century not this century the other one the idea was to take a piece of paper and fold it inside out using only your weaker hand in my case the left hand something that would look like <unk> 's okay i understand why we stop thinking too soon <unk> but if we give it a little bit more thought like a paper clip a paper clip makes this a little bit more interesting not only that if instead of using my hand with the fingers <unk> use my hand closed into a fist that makes this even a little bit more interesting not only that but i will impose myself a time limit of one second something that would look like this  now no no no sturgeon may <unk> but he doesn 't have to be correct forever things can always change sir what was the card the ten of hearts <unk> there 's this to prove that things can always change the ten of hearts  secrets are important  and secrets are valuable <unk> and this is the best secret i 've ever experienced <unk> it starts with a deck of cards onto the table an old man and a claim i will not touch the deck till the end  it doesn 't matter who the man was all that matters was that sentence ringing in my head  i will not touch the deck till the end now during all this time <unk> was holding a small notebook that sometimes he would open and flip through the pages and look at something but i was not really paying attention to the book because i was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before i will not touch the deck till the end now sir you have the giraffe go ahead <unk> throw it in any direction so that you can find someone else at random <unk> perfect sir <unk> you 're going to play my role in this story <unk> the old man turned to me and he said you could pick a red card or a black card my answer was <unk> could be a high spade or a low spade and my answer was audience member two a high spade hg  indeed <unk>  it was a high spade since it 's a high spade it could be a nine a ten a jack king queen or the ace of spades <unk> and my answer was <unk> selected spade <unk> you selected the high spade <unk> and you selected sorry audience member two king hg king of spades did you feel i influenced you in any decision audience member two  no i just felt your energy hg  but it was a free choice correct <unk> because if not we could start all over again but it was really fair audience member two absolutely hg now <unk> the old man turned to me and he asked me one more <unk> it was the seventeen <unk> the old man only said one more thing this is the end  and i knew exactly what that meant i knew that he was going to touch the deck <unk>  everything that you 're about to see is exactly it looked he took the deck out of the box nothing in the box <unk> he counted <unk> and on the seventeen instead of the king of spades <unk> something appeared in the middle of the deck that later <unk> i would realize <unk> the old man stood up he left i never saw him again <unk> but he left his notebook that was there from the beginning and when i picked it up that was the best secret i 've ever experienced we are defined by the secrets we keep and by the secrets we share <unk> and this was his way of sharing a secret with me <unk> all the time i really do and the reason why we don 't see them as often it 's because we don 't place ourselves in a position to search for those amazing things <unk>  but what if what if we decided to search for those amazing things for those small coincidences in life that are truly amazing so you have the giraffe go ahead throw it in any direction so you find one last person at random <unk>  sir <unk>  i 'm going to ask you do you have with you a united states $ one bill audience member three  i think so hg yes <unk> you see a coincidence <unk> i want you to do exactly the same thing i am about to do <unk> i have a dollar bill here to explain i want you to take the dollar bill and fold the washington part inside like this so you get this kind of big square okay <unk> now i want you to take the bill and fold it like this lengthwise so it becomes <unk> really fold it really crease it and when you have it <unk> please fold the bill again into a little square like this and let me know when you have it  do you have it perfect now <unk> i 'm going to approach <unk>  and before we start i want to make sure that we do this in very very serious conditions first of all <unk> i want to ensure that we have a marker and we have a paper <unk> first of all take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill and this is the reason why later <unk> i 'm going to be doing a bunch of stuff on stage and i don 't want you to think oh <unk> <unk> while i was distracted by helder someone came onstage and swapped the bill so i want to make sure it 's exactly the same bill now not only that i want you to take the paper clip and put it around <unk> the bill <unk> so even if nobody comes onstage and switches the bill i don 't have enough time to go open the bill and close it and see what i don 't want to see is that fair now you can give me the marker back and just like that very clearly <unk> i want to make sure that we place this in full view from the beginning of this experience and to make sure that everyone is going to see it we 're going to actually have a camera man onstage yes <unk> perfect so that you can see that 's your signature <unk> yes <unk> perfect now we 're going to use also the deck and a glass for this and we 're going to put ourselves in a position to search for an amazing coincidence do you mind can you help me with this go ahead and take some cards and shuffle and <unk> do you mind can you take some cards and shuffle <unk> <unk> you can shuffle cards in a variety of ways you can shuffle cards like this  you can shuffle cards in a more messed up way something like this you can shuffle cards in the american way as a portuguese i don 't feel entitled to teach you guys how to do it  but the important part is after shuffling the cards always remember to cut and complete the cards do you mind doing that for me sir <unk> please cut and complete and when you have it place the cards up in the air <unk> and you too cut and complete and up in the air up in the air <unk> and five people now very clearly i 'm going to gather the deck together <unk>  and just like that i 'm going to search for a coincidence in front of everyone i 'm going to try i have some cards that maybe maybe they don 't mean anything  but maybe that 's because we are not paying close attention  because maybe maybe they mean a lot before we start sir you gave me a dollar bill  is that your signature audience member three yes it is hg i want you to see very clearly <unk> that i 'm going to open your bill and reveal a small secret that we created and the secret of this dollar bill is the serial number <unk>  <unk> can you take the dollar bill in the serial number there is a letter what is the first number after the letter <unk> q like in queen <unk> 's my show thank you very much and have a nice night
