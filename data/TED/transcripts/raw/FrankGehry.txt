 <unk> 'm going to go right into the slides and all i 'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that i do just very straight stuff and my ideas are in my head anyway they 're very logical and relate to what 's going on <unk> problem solving for clients i either convince clients at the end that that i solve their problems or i really do solve their problems because usually they seem to like it let me go right into the slides can you turn off the <unk> in the dark <unk> i don 't want you to see what i 'm doing up here anyway i did this house in santa monica <unk> and it got a lot of notoriety in fact <unk> it appeared in a porno comic book <unk> which is the slide on the right <unk> this is in venice <unk> i just show it because i want you to know i 'm concerned about context on the left hand side <unk>  i had the context of those little houses <unk> and i tried to build a building that fit into that context when people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird <unk>  and my premise is that they make a lot more <unk> sense when they 're photographed or seen in in that space <unk> and then <unk> once i deal with the context <unk> i then try to make a a place that 's comfortable and private and fairly serene as i hope you 'll find that slide on the right <unk> and then i did a law school for loyola in downtown <unk> l a i was concerned about making a place for the study of law <unk> and we continue to work with with this client the building on the right at the top is now under construction <unk> the garage on the right the gray structure will be torn down finally and <unk> several small classrooms will be placed along this avenue that we 've created this campus <unk> and it all related to the clients and the and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place they wanted a sense of place <unk> and so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown <unk> in a neighborhood that was difficult to to fit into <unk> and it was my theory or my point of view that one didn 't upstage the neighborhood one made accommodations i tried to be inclusive to include the buildings in the <unk> they were buildings i liked or not  in the ' 60s i started working with paper furniture and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in bloomingdale 's  we even made flooring walls and everything out of cardboard <unk>  and the success of it threw me for a loop <unk> i couldn 't deal with the success of furniture i wasn 't secure enough as an architect and so i closed it all up and made <unk> furniture that nobody would like  so nobody would like this and it was in this <unk> preliminary to these pieces of furniture that ricky and i worked on furniture by the slice <unk> and after we failed i just kept failing the piece on the left and that ultimately led to the piece on the right happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket <unk>  and i put a piece of tape around it as you see there <unk> and realized you could sit <unk> on it and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on so it was an accidental discovery i got into fish  <unk> i mean the story i tell is that i got mad at postmodernism at po mo and said that fish were five hundred million years earlier than man  and if you 're going to go back we might as well go back to the beginning <unk> and so i started making these funny things <unk> and they <unk> started to have a life of their own and got bigger as the one glass at the walker <unk> and then  i sliced off the head and the tail and everything and and tried to translate what i was learning about the form of the fish and the movement and a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it accidental again it was it was an <unk> intuitive kind of thing and i just kept going with it and made this proposal for a building which was only a proposal  i did this building in japan <unk> i was taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed <unk> and i love sake and kobe and all that stuff  <unk> i was really drunk i was asked to do some sketches on napkins  and i made some sketches on napkins little boxes and morandi like things that i used to do <unk>  and the client said why no fish and so i made a <unk> it 's harder to do it <unk> i work with a little once in a while told me i couldn 't do it <unk> and so that made it even more exciting <unk> but he was right i couldn 't do the tail i started to get the head ok but the tail i couldn 't do it was pretty hard the thing on the right is a snake form a ziggurat <unk> and i put them together and you walk between them <unk> it was a dialog with the context again now if you saw a picture of this as it was published in architectural record they didn 't show the context so you would think god what a pushy guy this is but a friend of mine spent four hours wandering <unk> as for craft and technology and all those things that you 've all been talking about  i was thrown for a complete loop this was built in six months the way we sent drawings to <unk> magic computer in michigan that does carved models <unk> and we used to make foam models <unk> which that thing scanned <unk> we made the drawings of the fish and the scales and when i got there <unk> everything was perfect except the tail  so i decided to cut off the head and the <unk> and i made the object on the left for my show at the walker <unk> and it 's one of the nicest pieces i 've ever made i think and then jay <unk> and client asked me to do his headquarters building in l a for reasons we don 't want to talk about it got delayed <unk> toxic waste i guess is the <unk> so we built a temporary building i 'm getting good at temporary and we put a conference room in that 's a fish  and finally jay dragged me to my hometown toronto canada and there is a story it 's a real story about my grandmother buying a carp on thursday bringing it home putting it <unk> when i went to sleep the next day it wasn 't there and the next night we had gefilte fish  and so i set up this interior for jay 's offices and i made a pedestal for a sculpture <unk> and he didn 't buy a sculpture so i made one i went around toronto and found a bathtub like my <unk> we 've been friends for a long time <unk> and we 've started to work on things a few years ago <unk> we did a <unk> those two little boys are my sons <unk> and they were claes ' assistants in the play he was the swiss army knife <unk> he was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter <unk> and i was frankie p toronto <unk> p for palladio dressed up like the at & t building by claes  with a fish hat <unk>  the highlight of the performance was at the at the end  this beautiful object the swiss army knife <unk> which i get credit for participating in i can tell you it 's totally an oldenburg i had nothing to do with it the only thing i did was  i made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal because i love sailing we made it into a sailing craft  i 've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing i do it because it 's a curious thing in the culture <unk> are made in such great quantities absorbed in such great quantities <unk> and there 's so much denial about them  people hate it and i 'm fascinated with that which like the paper furniture it 's one of those materials and i 'm always drawn to that  and so i did a lot of dirty things with chain link which nobody will forgive me for but claes made homage to it in the loyola law school <unk> and that chain <unk> link is really expensive it 's in perspective and everything  and then we did a camp together for children with cancer <unk>  and you can see we started making a building together of course the milk can is his  but we were trying to collide our ideas to put objects next to each other like a morandi like the little bottles <unk> composing them like a still life <unk> and it seemed to work as a way to put he and i together then jay chiat asked me to do this building <unk> on this funny lot in venice <unk> and i started with this three piece <unk> and you entered in the middle and jay asked me what i was going to do with the piece in the middle <unk> and he pushed that and one day i had a oh well  the other way i had the binoculars from claes and i put them there and i could never get rid of them after that oldenburg made the binoculars incredible when he sent me the first model of the real proposal <unk> it made my building look sick <unk> and it was this <unk> interaction between that kind of up the ante stuff that became pretty interesting it led to the building on the left  and i still think the time magazine picture will be of the binoculars i have a hard time connecting with the craft the whole thing about my house the whole use of rough carpentry and everything was the frustration with the crafts available i said if i can 't get the craft that i want i 'll use the craft i can get there were plenty of models for that in rauschenberg and jasper johns and many artists who were <unk> making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials i went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture and it was all of one material and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls the metalworkers for the most part do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff i was given an opportunity <unk> design an exhibit for the metalworkers ' unions of america and canada in washington <unk> and i did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings <unk> etc etc and it 's working very well to have these people these <unk> i just tell the stories it 's a way of connecting at least with some of those people that are so important to the realization of architecture  the metal continued into a building herman miller in sacramento <unk> and it 's just a complex <unk> herman miller has this philosophy of having a place a people place i mean it 's kind of a trite thing to say but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be where the people would come and where the people working would interact so it 's out in the middle of nowhere <unk> approach it <unk> it 's copper and galvanize i used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge so it would buckle <unk> i spent a lot of time undoing richard meier 's aesthetic <unk> everybody 's trying to get the panels perfect and i <unk> to get them sloppy and fuzzy and they end up looking like stone <unk> this is the central area there 's a ramp and that little dome in there is a building by stanley tigerman stanley was instrumental in my getting this job <unk> and when i was awarded the contract i at the very beginning asked the client if they would let stanley do a cameo piece with me because these were ideas that we were talking about <unk> things next to each other making it 's all about [ a ] metaphor for a city maybe  and so stanley did the little dome thing <unk> and we did it over the phone and by fax he would send me a fax and show me something he 'd made a building with a dome <unk> with a simpler building <unk> but he put some funny details on it and he moved it closer to my building and so i decided to put him in a in a depression i put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in and so then he put two bridges this all happened on the fax going back and forth over a couple <unk> weeks ' period and he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it <unk> and so then i put this big billboard behind it and it was a very prominent building off the freeway and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of i thought the language of the neighborhood <unk> which had these cornices projecting cornices mine got a little exuberant but i used <unk> which is a beautiful material <unk> and it turns green in one hundred years instead of like copper in ten or fifteen <unk> we redid the side of the building and re proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space and it surprised both boston and myself that we got it approved because they have very strict kind of design guideline and they wouldn 't normally think i would fit them <unk>  the detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building  <unk> ramblas for some film festival i did the hollywood sign going and coming made a building out of it <unk> and they built it i flew in one night and took this picture but they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me <unk>  and then more metal and <unk> in santa monica a little shopping center <unk>  and this is a laser laboratory at the university of iowa in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back <unk> it 's the the support labs which by some coincidence required no windows and the shape fit perfectly i just joined the points <unk> in the curved part there 's all the mechanical equipment <unk> that solid wall behind it is a pipe chase a pipe canyon and so it was an opportunity that i seized because i didn 't have to have any protruding ducts <unk> or vents or things in this form it gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it  this is a small house somewhere <unk> they 've been building it so long i don 't remember where it is it 's in the west valley <unk> and we started with the stream and built the house <unk> along the stream dammed it up to make a lake <unk> these are the models the reality with the lake the workmanship is pretty bad  and it reminded me why i play defensively in things like my house when you have to do something really cheaply it 's hard to get perfect corners and that big metal thing is a passage <unk> you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom which is on the right it 's kind of like a whole built town <unk>  i was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at yale i thought it was fitting for me to <unk> be doing that  this is a house next to a philip johnson house in minnesota <unk> the owners had a dilemma they asked philip to do it he was too busy <unk> he <unk> ended up having to make it a sculpture because the dilemma was how do you build a building that doesn 't look like the language is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub divided etc etc <unk> you 've got the idea and so we finally ended up making it these people are art collectors <unk>  and we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the the main house and all the windows are on the other side <unk> and the building is very sculptural as you walk around it it 's made of metal and the brown stuff is <unk> 't work i keep trying to make it work in this case we learned how to detail it  in cleveland <unk> there 's burnham mall on the left it 's never been finished going out to the lake <unk> you can <unk> and we had the opportunity to build a building on this site there 's a railroad track this is the city hall over here somewhere and the courthouse <unk> and the centerline of the mall goes out burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built and so we followed sohio is on the axis here <unk> and we followed the axis and <unk> kind of goalposts <unk> and this is our building which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company <unk> we collaborated with oldenburg and put the newspaper on top folded the health <unk> you drive down so it 's about a 10 story c clamp  and all this stuff at the bottom is a museum and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry this owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries <unk>  and this would be a hotel so the centerline of this thing we 'd preserve it <unk> and it would start to work <unk> with the scale of the new buildings by pelli and kohn pederson fox <unk> etc that are underway it 's hard to do high rise i i feel much more comfortable down here <unk> this is a piece of property in brentwood and a long time ago about ' eighty two or something after my house i designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard and and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left and she came back <unk> guess wealthier or something something happened and asked me to design a house for her on this site  and following that basic idea of the village <unk>  we changed it as we got into it <unk> i locked the the house into the site by cutting the back end here you see on the photographs <unk> of the site slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom which i designed like a kind of a barge <unk>  looking like a boat and <unk> the dome was a request from the client she wanted a dome somewhere in the house she didn 't care where  when you sleep in this bedroom i hope i mean i haven 't slept in it yet i 've offered to marry her so i could sleep there <unk>  but she said i didn 't have to do that but <unk> you feel like you 're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake and it 's very private the landscape is being built around to create a private garden <unk> and then up above there 's a garden on this side of the living room and one on the other <unk> know how to do it from here focus the one on the right it 's up there <unk> left it 's my right <unk>  anyway you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees that 's the living <unk> you enter into the living room and then so on  this is the bedroom you come down from this level along the stairway and you enter the bedroom here going into the lake and the bed is back in this space with windows looking out onto the lake these <unk> things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot  the material is lead copper like in the building in boston  and so it was an intent to make this small piece of land it 's one hundred by two hundred and fifty into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it and this happened by accident that i got this right on axis with the dining room table <unk> looks like i got a baldessari painting for free but the idea is the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house outside eventually this will be screened these trees will come up and it will be very private and you feel like you 're in your own kind of village <unk>  this is for <unk> michael eisner disney we 're doing some work for him <unk> and this is in anaheim california <unk> and it 's a freeway building you go go under this bridge at about sixty five miles an hour <unk> and there 's another bridge here and you 're through this room in a split second <unk> and the building will sort of <unk> on the backside it 's much more humane entrance <unk> dining hall etc <unk> and then this thing here i 'm hoping as you drive by you 'll hear the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it kind of a fun thing to do  i 'm doing a building in switzerland basel <unk> which is an office building for a furniture company <unk>  and we struggled with the image these are the early studies but they have to sell furniture to normal people so if i did the building and it was too fancy then people might say well the furniture looks ok in his thing but no it ain 't going to look good in my normal building  so we 've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here <unk> and we 've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them so that the communal space is <unk> very sculptural and separate <unk> and you 're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces <unk> this is in paris along the <unk> <unk> over here the minister of finance the guy that moved from the louvre goes in here <unk> there 's a new library across the river <unk> and back in here in this already treed park <unk> we 're doing a very dense building called the american center which has a theater apartments <unk> dance school an art museum <unk> restaurants and all kinds of it 's a very dense program bookstores <unk> in a very tight small this is the ground level and the french have this extraordinary way of screwing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off they call it the plan coupe <unk> and i struggled with that thing how to get around the corner <unk> these are the models for <unk> this is the way i organized myself so i could make the drawing so i understood the problem i was trying to get around this plan coupe how do you do it apartments etc <unk> kind of study models we did  and the one on the left is pretty awful <unk> you can see why i was ready to commit suicide when this one was built <unk> but out of it came finally this resolution where the elevator piece worked frontally to this parallel to this street and also parallel to here and then this kind of <unk> with this balcony and the skirt kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer the restaurants here the apartments and the theater etc so it would all be built in stone in french limestone <unk> except for this metal piece and it faces into a park and the idea was to make this express the energy of this  on the side <unk> facing the street it 's much more normal except i slipped a few mansards down so that coming on the point these housing units made a gesture to the corner <unk>  <unk> you guys have any ideas for it please contact me i don 't know what to do <unk>  jay chiat is a glutton for punishment and he hired me to do a house for him in the hamptons <unk>  and it 's got a fish <unk> and i keep thinking this is going to be the last fish  it 's like a drug addict i say i 'm not going to do it anymore i don 't want to do it anymore i 'm not going to do it <unk> i do it there it is but it 's the living room and this piece here is i don 't know what it is i just added it so that we 'd have enough money in the budget so we could take something out <unk> and i 've worked with all of the guys that presented to you earlier <unk> we 've had a lot of fun working together i think i 'm from mars for them and they are for me but somehow we all manage to work together and and the hotel that tony baxter 's group is doing out here <unk> and then this is a kind of a shopping mall with a rodeo and restaurants and another restaurant <unk> <unk> what i did because of the paris skies being quite dull i made a light grid that 's perpendicular to the train station to the route of the train <unk> it looks like it <unk> it 's kind of been there <unk> and then crashed all these simpler forms into it the light grid will have a light be lit up at night and and give a kind of light ceiling <unk> rhine across from basel <unk> we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum <unk>  and i tried to there 's a nick grimshaw building over here there 's an oldenburg sculpture over here i tried to make a relationship urbanistically and i don 't gave good slides to show it 's just been completed but this piece here is this building and these pieces here and here and as you pass by it 's always <unk> part you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood <unk> it 's plaster and just zinc <unk>  and you wonder if this is a museum what it 's going to be like inside <unk> going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn 't show anything <unk> and just wait i 'm so cunning and clever i made it quiet and wonderful <unk> but on the outside it does scream out at you a bit <unk>  it 's actually basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff and from the building in the back you see it <unk> iceberg floating by in the hills down and becomes that one so it 's pretty quiet inside <unk>  this is the disney hall the concert hall <unk> it 's a complicated project it has a chamber hall <unk> it 's related to an existing chandler pavilion that was built with a lot of love and <unk> and caring <unk> and it 's not a great building but i approached it optimistically that we would make a compositional relationship between us that would strengthen both of us and the plan of this it 's a concert hall this is the foyer <unk> which is kind of a garden structure there 's commercial at the ground floor these are offices which really in the competition we didn 't have to design but finally there 's a hotel there <unk>  these were the kind of relationships made to the chandler <unk> composing these elevations together and relating them to the buildings that existed <unk> in the competition gave us criteria which led to this compartmentalized scheme <unk> which we found out after the competition would not work at all but everybody liked these forms and liked the space and so that 's one of the problems of a competition you have to then try and get that back in some way <unk> and we studied many models <unk> this was our original model these were the three buildings that were the ideal the concertgebouw boston and berlin <unk> everybody liked the surround <unk> actually this is the smallest hall in size and it has more seats than any of <unk> because it has double balconies our client doesn 't want balconies so and when we met our new acoustician he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape <unk> and we tried many shapes trying to get the energy of the original design within an acoustical acceptable format <unk> finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later decided they weren 't but now we have them and our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room <unk> the idea <unk>  and the corners would have skylights and these columns would be structural <unk> and the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit  and create intimacy now  <unk> this is not a final design these are just on the way to being and so i wouldn 't take it literally except the feeling of the space <unk> we studied the acoustics with laser stuff <unk> and they bounce them off this and see where it all works but you get the sense of the hall in section most halls come straight down into a <unk> this case we 're opening it back up and getting skylights in the four corners and so it will be quite a different shape  the original building <unk>  because it was frog like fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well when you get into a box it 's harder to do it and here we are struggling with how to put the hotel in <unk> teapot i designed for alessi <unk> i just stuck it on there <unk> but this is how i do work i do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away and of course it 's not going to look like that but it is the crazy way i tend to work <unk> and then finally <unk> i was asked to do a sculpture at the foot of interstate bank tower the highest building in l a larry halprin is doing the stairs and i was asked to do a fish and so i did a snake  laughter it 's a public space and i made it kind of a garden structure and you can go in it it 's a kiva and larry 's putting some water in there <unk> and it works much better than a fish in barcelona i was asked to do a fish and <unk> 're working on that at the foot of a ritz carlton tower being done by skidmore owings and merrill and the <unk> ritz carlton tower is being designed with exposed steel much like those old gas tanks <unk> and so we took the language of this exposed steel and and used it perverted it into the form of the and created a kind of a 19th century contraption that looks like  that will sit this is the beach and the harbor out in front <unk> and this is really a shopping center with department stores <unk> and we split these bridges originally this was all solid with a hole in it we cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel <unk> this to the hotel people the other day <unk> and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the ritz carlton anymore  because of this fish  and finally i just threw these in lou danziger i didn 't expect lou danziger <unk> to be here but this is a building i did for him in one thousand nine hundred and sixty four i think a little studio and it 's sadly for sale time goes on <unk> and this is my son working with me on a small fast food thing he designed the robot as the cashier <unk> head moves and i did the rest of it and the food wasn 't as good as the stuff and so it failed it should have been the other way around the food should have been good first it didn 't work
