 <unk> to share with you today is my challenge as an iranian artist <unk> as an iranian woman artist as an iranian woman artist living in exile well pluses and minuses on the dark side politics doesn 't seem to escape people like me  every iranian artist in one form or another is political politics have defined our lives  if you 're living in iran you 're facing censorship <unk> harassment <unk> arrest torture at times <unk> execution <unk> if you 're living outside like me you 're faced with life in exile the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family  therefore we don 't find the moral <unk> emotional <unk> psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility <unk> oddly enough an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice <unk> the speaker of my people <unk> even if i have indeed <unk> no access to my own country  also people like myself we 're fighting two battles on different grounds we 're being critical of the west the perception of the west about our identity about the image that is constructed about us about our <unk> women about our politics about our religion <unk>  we are there to take pride and insist on respect and at the same time we 're fighting another battle  that is our regime our government our atrocious government [ that ] has done every crime in order to stay in power our artists are at <unk> risk we are in a position of danger we pose a threat to the order of the government <unk>  but ironically <unk>  this situation has empowered all of us  because we are considered as artists <unk> central to the cultural political social discourse in iran  we are there to inspire to provoke  <unk> mobilize to bring hope to our people we are the reporters of our people and are communicators to the outside world  art is our weapon  culture is a form of resistance <unk> i envy sometimes the artists of the west for their freedom of expression for the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of <unk> politics from the fact that they are only serving one audience mainly the western culture <unk>  but also i worry about the west  because often in this country in this western world that we have  culture risks being a form of entertainment  our people depend on our <unk> communication  my journey as an artist started from a very very personal place <unk>  i did not start to make social commentary about my country <unk>  the first one that you see in front of you is actually when i first returned to iran after being separated <unk> i was absent from iran the islamic revolution had descended on iran and had entirely transformed the country from persian to the islamic culture  i came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that i found my place in the society <unk>  but instead <unk> i found a country that was totally ideological and that i didn 't recognize anymore <unk> more so i became very interested as i was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions <unk>  i became immersed in the study of the islamic revolution how indeed <unk> it had incredibly transformed the lives of iranian women  i found the subject of iranian women immensely interesting in the way the women of iran <unk> embody the political transformation so in a way by studying a woman you can read the structure and the ideology of the country  so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life <unk> and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse the subject of martyrdom <unk> the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of god <unk> faith <unk> but violence and crime and cruelty  for me this became incredibly important <unk> and yet <unk>  i had an unusual position toward this i was an outsider who had come back to iran to find my place <unk> but i was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the islamic revolution this changed slowly as i found my voice and i discovered things that i didn 't know i would discover so my art became slightly more critical my knife became a little sharper  and i fell into a life in exile <unk>  i am a nomadic artist <unk> i work in morocco in turkey in mexico <unk> i go everywhere to make believe it 's iran am making films <unk>  last year i finished a film called women without men  women without men returns to history <unk> but another part of our iranian history it goes to one thousand nine <unk> when american cia exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader dr mossadegh <unk> the book is written by an iranian woman shahrnush parsipur it 's a magical realist novel this book is banned and she spent five years in prison  my obsession with this book and the reason i made this into a film is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female traditionally historically in iran and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change freedom and democracy while the country of iran <unk> as if another character also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions  i made this film because i felt it 's important for it to speak to the westerners about our history as a country that all of you seem to remember iran after the islamic revolution that iran was once a secular society <unk> and we had <unk> democracy and this democracy was stolen from us by the american government by the british government this film also speaks to the iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so islamicized in the way we looked <unk> in the way we played music in the way we had intellectual life <unk> and most of all <unk> the way that we fought for democracy  these are some of the shots actually from my film  these are some of the images of the coup and we made this film in casablanca <unk>  recreating all the shots this film tried to find a balance between telling a political story but also a feminine story <unk> i am foremost interested to make art to make art that transcends politics religion the question of feminism  and become an important <unk> timeless <unk> universal work of art the challenge i have is how to do that  how to tell a political story but an allegorical story how to move you with your emotions <unk> but also make your mind work these are some of the images and the characters of the film  <unk> now comes the green movement the summer of two thousand and nine <unk> as my film is released the uprising begins in the streets of tehran <unk>  <unk> the period that we tried to depict in the film  the cry for democracy and social social justice <unk> repeats itself now again in tehran the green movement significantly inspired the world  it brought a lot of attention to all those iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy what was most significant for me was once again the presence of the women they 're absolutely inspirational for me <unk>  if in the islamic revolution the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn 't have a voice <unk>  now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of tehran women who were educated <unk> forward thinking <unk> and those young men united iranians across the world <unk> inside and outside  i then discovered why i take so much inspiration from iranian women  that under all circumstances <unk> they have pushed the boundary they have confronted the authority they have broken every rule in the smallest and <unk> the biggest way <unk> and once again they proved themselves i stand here to say that iranian women have found a new voice and their voice is giving me my voice and it 's a great honor to be an iranian woman and an iranian artist <unk> even if i have to operate in the west only for now
