 <unk> so my freshman year of college i signed up for an internship in the housing unit at greater boston legal services <unk>  showed up the first day ready to make coffee and photocopies <unk> but was paired with this <unk> deeply inspired attorney named jeff purcell who thrust me onto the front lines from the very first day <unk>  and over the course of nine months i had the chance to have dozens of conversations with low income families in boston who would come in presenting with housing issues but always had an underlying health issue <unk>  so i had a client who came in about to be evicted because he hasn 't paid his rent <unk> but he hasn 't paid his rent of course because he 's paying for his <unk> hiv medication and just can 't afford both  we had moms who would come in daughter has asthma <unk> wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning  and one of our litigation strategies was actually to send me into the home of these clients with these large glass bottles <unk>  and i would collect the cockroaches hot glue gun them to this poster board that we 'd bring to court for our cases <unk>  and we always won because the <unk> judges were just so grossed out far more effective i have to say than anything i later learned in law school <unk>  but over the course of these nine months i grew frustrated with feeling like we were intervening too far downstream in the lives of our clients that by the time they came to us <unk> they were already in <unk> and at the end of my freshman year of college i read an article about the work that dr barry zuckerman was doing as chair of pediatrics at boston medical center <unk> and his first hire was a legal services attorney to represent the patients <unk>  so i called barry and with his blessing in october <unk> walked into the waiting room of the pediatrics clinic at boston medical center i <unk> never forget the tvs played this endless reel of cartoons  and the exhaustion of mothers who had taken two <unk> three <unk> sometimes four buses to bring their child to the doctor was just palpable <unk>  the doctors it seemed never really had enough time for all the patients try as they might and over the course of six months i would corner them in the hallway and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question  if you had unlimited resources what 's the one thing you would give your patients and i heard the same story again and again a story we 've heard hundreds of times since then  they said every day we have patients that come into the clinic child has an ear infection i prescribe antibiotics <unk> but the real issue is there 's no food at home <unk>  the real issue is that child is living with twelve other <unk> and i don 't even ask about those issues because there 's nothing i can do <unk>  i have thirteen minutes with each patient patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room <unk> i have no idea where the nearest food pantry is <unk> and i don 't even have any help  in that clinic even today there are two social workers for twenty four thousand pediatric patients <unk> which is better than a lot of the clinics out there <unk>  so health leads was born of these conversations a simple model where doctors and nurses <unk> can prescribe nutritious food heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they prescribe medication  patients then take their prescriptions to our desk in the clinic waiting room where we have a core of well trained college student advocates who work side by side <unk> <unk> with these families to connect them out to the existing landscape of community resources <unk>  <unk> with a card table in the clinic waiting room totally lemonade stand style <unk>  but today we have a thousand college student advocates who are working to connect nearly nine thousand patients and their families with the resources that they need to be healthy <unk>  so eighteen months ago i got this email that changed my life and the email was from dr jack geiger who had written to congratulate me on health leads <unk> and to share as he said a bit of historical context in <unk> <unk> geiger founded one of the first two community health centers in this country in a brutally poor area in the mississippi delta <unk>  and so many of his patients came in presenting with malnutrition that be began prescribing food for them <unk> and they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket which would fill them and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic <unk>  and when the office of economic opportunity in washington d c which was funding geiger 's clinic found out about this they were furious <unk>  and they sent this bureaucrat down to tell geiger that he was expected to use their dollars for medical care to which geiger famously and logically responded the last time i checked my textbooks the specific therapy for malnutrition was food so when i got this email from dr geiger i knew i was supposed to be proud to be part of this history <unk> but the truth is i was devastated  here we are forty five years after geiger has prescribed food for his patients <unk> and i have doctors telling me on <unk> years after geiger health leads has to reinvent the prescription for basic resources <unk>  so i have spent hours upon hours trying to make sense of this weird groundhog day <unk>  how is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients and especially low income patients healthy that we didn 't use it  if we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick care system <unk> why don 't we just do it  these questions in my mind are not hard because the answers are complicated  they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves  my belief is that it 's almost too painful to articulate our aspirations for <unk> our healthcare system or even admit that we have any at all because if we did they would be so removed from our current reality <unk>  but that doesn 't change my belief that all of us <unk> deep inside <unk> here in this room and across this country <unk> share a similar set of desires  that if we are honest with ourselves and listen quietly <unk> that we all harbor one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare that it keep us healthy  this aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy is an enormously powerful one <unk> and the way i think about this is that healthcare is like any other system it 's just a set of choices that people make  what if we decided to make a different set of choices <unk> what if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare that have drifted away from us and stand firm and say no these things are ours <unk>  they will be used for our purposes <unk> they will be used to realize our aspiration  what if everything we needed to realize our aspiration for healthcare was right there in front of us just waiting to be claimed <unk>  so that 's where health leads <unk> we started with the prescription pad a very ordinary piece of paper and we asked not what do patients need to get healthy antibiotics an inhaler medication but what do patients need to be healthy to not get sick in the first place <unk> and we chose to use the prescription for that purpose <unk>  so just a few miles from here at children 's national medical center when patients come into <unk> they 're asked a few questions <unk> they 're asked are you running out of food at the end of the month do you have safe housing  and when the doctor begins the visit she knows height <unk> weight is there food at home is the family living in a shelter <unk> and that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices <unk> but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient using health leads like any other <unk> referral <unk> the problem is once you get a taste of what it 's like to realize your aspiration for <unk> healthcare you want more <unk>  so we thought if we can get individual doctors to prescribe these basic resources for their patients <unk>  could we get an entire healthcare system to shift its presumption  and we gave it a shot <unk> so now at harlem hospital center when patients come in with an elevated body mass index the electronic medical record automatically generates a prescription for health leads <unk> our volunteers can then work with them to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs in their communities  we 've created a presumption that if you 're a patient at that hospital with an elevated bmi <unk>  the four walls of the doctor 's office probably aren 't going to give you everything you need to be healthy you need more <unk>  so on the one hand this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record and on the other hand it 's a radical transformation of the electronic medical record from a static repository of diagnostic information to a health promotion tool  in the private sector when you squeeze that kind of additional value out of a fixed cost investment it 's called a billion dollar company <unk>  but in my world it 's called reduced obesity and <unk> it 's called healthcare a system where doctors can prescribe solutions to improve health not just manage disease <unk>  same thing in the clinic waiting room <unk> so every day in this country three million patients pass through about one hundred and fifty thousand clinic waiting rooms in this country <unk>  and what do they do when they 're there <unk>  they sit  they watch the goldfish in the fish tank <unk> they read extremely old copies of good housekeeping magazine <unk>  <unk> we all just sit there forever waiting how did we get here where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours to waiting  what if we had a waiting room where you don 't just sit when you 're sick but where you go to get healthy <unk>  if airports can become shopping malls and mcdonald 's can become playgrounds <unk> surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room and that 's what health leads has tried to <unk> do to reclaim that real estate and that time and to use it as a gateway to connect patients to the resources they need to be healthy <unk>  so it 's a brutal winter in the northeast your kid has asthma your heat just got turned off and of course you 're in the waiting room of the er because the cold air triggered your child 's asthma <unk>  but what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously <unk> the waiting room became the place where health leads turned your heat back on  and of course all <unk> of this requires a broader workforce but if we 're creative we already have that too we know that our doctors and nurses and even social workers aren 't enough that the ticking minutes of health care are too constraining health just takes more time it requires a <unk> army of community health workers and case managers and many others what if a small part of that next healthcare workforce were the eleven million college students in this country <unk>  unencumbered by clinical responsibilities <unk> unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients  and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using google  now lest you think it improbable that a college volunteer can make <unk> this kind of commitment <unk> i have two words for you march madness <unk>  the average ncaa division i men 's basketball player dedicates thirty nine hours a week to his sport <unk>  now we may think that 's good or bad but in either case it 's real and health leads is based on the presumption that for too <unk> too long we have asked too little of our college students when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities  college sports teams say we 're going to take dozens of hours at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning and we 're going to measure your performance and your team 's performance and if you don 't measure up or you don 't show up we 're going to cut you off the team  but we 'll make huge investments in your training and development and we 'll give you an <unk> and people line up out the door just for the chance to be part of it so our feeling is if it 's good enough for the rugby team it 's good enough for health and poverty  health leads too recruits competitively <unk> trains intensively <unk> coaches professionally <unk> demands significant time builds a cohesive team and measures results a kind of teach for america for <unk> now in the top ten cities in the u s with the largest number of medicaid patients <unk> each of those has at least twenty thousand college students new york alone has half a million college students  and this isn 't just a sort of short term workforce to connect patients to basic resources  it 's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline who 've spent two three four years in the clinic waiting room <unk> talking to patients about their most basic health needs <unk> and they leave with the conviction the ability and the efficacy to realize our most basic aspirations for health care  and the thing is there 's thousands of these folks already out there <unk>  so mia lozada is chief resident of internal medicine at ucsf medical center <unk> but for three years as an undergraduate she was a health leads volunteer in the clinic waiting room at <unk> when my classmates write a prescription <unk> they think their work is done  when i write a prescription i think can the family read the prescription  do they have transportation to the pharmacy do they have food to take with the prescription <unk> do they have insurance to fill the prescription  those are the questions i learned at health leads not in medical school  now none of these solutions the prescription pad the electronic medical record the waiting room the army of college students are perfect <unk> perfect <unk> but they are ours for the taking simple examples of the vast <unk> healthcare resources that if we reclaimed and redeployed could realize our most basic aspiration of healthcare  so i had been at legal services for about nine months when this idea of health leads started percolating in my mind <unk> and i knew i had to tell jeff purcell my attorney <unk> that i needed to leave and i was so nervous because i thought he was going to be disappointed in me for abandoning our clients for some crazy idea <unk>  and i sat down with him and i said jeff i have this idea that we could mobilize college students to address patients ' most basic health needs  and i 'll be honest all i wanted was for him to not be angry at me <unk>  but he said this when you have a vision you have an obligation to realize that vision you must pursue that vision  and i have to say i was like whoa  that 's a lot of pressure i just wanted a blessing i didn 't want some kind of mandate <unk>  but the truth is i 've spent every waking minute nearly since then chasing that vision <unk>  i believe that <unk> we all have a vision for healthcare in this country <unk>  i believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare <unk> it will not be by the diseases cured <unk> but by the diseases prevented <unk>  it will not be by the excellence of our technologies or the sophistication of our specialists <unk> but by how rarely we needed them  and most of all i believe that when we measure healthcare <unk> it will be not by what the system was but by what we chose it to be <unk> thank you
