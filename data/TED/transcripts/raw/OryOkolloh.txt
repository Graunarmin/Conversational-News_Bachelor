 <unk> image got do with it <unk> and i must say i think emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages because i 'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up but i 'm going to try and do something different and <unk> close the loop with some of my personal stories and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we 've been talking about  so africa is a complex continent full of contradictions as you can see  we 're not the only ones  applause and you know it 's <unk> we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent just think about that  you know <unk> and this is typically what we 've been talking about the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff now why is that a problem a typical disaster story <unk> disease corruption <unk> poverty <unk> and some of you might be standing here thinking <unk> all you privileged people come here saying ' forget the poor people let 's focus on business and the markets and whatever '  and they 're all there 's the eighty percent of africans who really need help and i want to tell you that this is my story <unk> ok <unk> and it 's the story of many of the africans who are here we start with poverty i didn 't grow up in the slums or anything that dire <unk> i know what it is to grow up without having money or being able to support family euvin was talking about bellwether signs <unk> the bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast you know when things were good <unk> we had eggs and sausages when things were bad we had porridge <unk> and like many african families my parents could never save because they supported siblings <unk> cousins <unk> you know <unk> their parents  and things were always dicey <unk> now when i was born they realized they had a pretty smart kid <unk> and they didn 't want me to go to the neighborhood school which was free <unk>  and they adopted a very interesting approach to education which was they were going to take me to a school <unk> that they can barely afford  so they took me to a private <unk> catholic <unk> elementary school <unk> which set the foundation for what ended up being my career <unk> and what happened was because they could afford it sometimes sometimes not i got kicked out pretty much every term <unk> you know <unk> someone would come in with a list of the people who haven 't paid school fees and when they started getting pretty strict you had to leave until your school fees could be paid <unk> i remember thinking <unk> i mean why don 't these guys just take me to a cheap school <unk> because you know <unk>  as a kid you 're embarrassed and you 're sensitive and everyone knows you guys don 't have money <unk> but they kept at it <unk> and i now understand why they did what they did <unk> we have an entrance exam to go into high school <unk>  and there 's national schools which are like the best schools and provincial schools  my dream school at that time was kenya high school a national school <unk> i missed the cutoff by one point <unk>  and i was so disappointed <unk> and i was like oh my god <unk> you know what am i going to do and my father said ok listen let 's go and try and talk to the headmistress you know it 's just one point i mean <unk> maybe she 'll let you in if <unk> that slot 's still there so we went to the school <unk>  and because we were nobodies <unk> and because we didn 't have privilege and because my father didn 't have the right last name <unk>  he was treated like dirt <unk> and i sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him saying you know who do you think you are and <unk> joking if you think you can get a slot <unk>  and i had gone to school with other girls who were kids of politicians and who had done much much worse than i did <unk> and they had slots there <unk>  and there 's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you <unk> you know <unk> and we left and i swore to myself and i was like i 'm never ever going to have to beg for anything in my life they called me two weeks later <unk> can come now and i told them to stuff it  final story and i sort of have to speak quickly <unk>  disease <unk> my father who i 've been talking about died of aids in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine  he never told anyone that he had aids his fear of the stigma was so strong <unk> and i 'm pretty much the one who figured it <unk> out because i was a nerd and i was in the states at the time and they called me he was very sick <unk> the first time he got sick <unk>  and he had cryptococcal meningitis <unk>  and so i went on to google cryptococcal meningitis <unk> you know because of doctor patient privilege they couldn 't really tell us what was going on <unk> but they were like you know this <unk> when i went online and looked at the infectious read about the disease i pretty much realized what was going on  the first time he got sick he recovered <unk>  but what happened was that he had to be on medication that at that time diflucan which in the states is used for yeast infections cost thirty dollars a pill he had to be on that pill for the rest of his life <unk> so money ran out he got sick again <unk> and up until that time he had a friend who used to travel to india and he used to import bring him could get him a generic version of it and that kept him going but the money ran out he got sick again he got sick on a friday <unk> only one bank that had atms in kenya <unk> and we could not get cash the family couldn 't get cash for him to start the treatment until monday the hospital put him on a water drip for three days  and finally we figured well ok we 'd better just try and take him to a public hospital at least he 'll get treated while we try to figure out the <unk> and he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him <unk> and you know <unk> now imagine if and i could go on and on imagine if this is all you know about me how would you look at me  with pity <unk> you know <unk> sadness <unk>  and this is how you look at africa <unk> this is the damage it causes you don 't see the other side of me <unk> you don 't see the <unk> blogger you don 't see the harvard educated lawyer the vibrant person <unk> you know <unk> and i just wanted to personalize that because we talk about it in big terms and you wonder you know so what but it 's damaging <unk> and i 'm not unique right imagine if all you knew about william was the fact that he grew up in a poor village and you didn 't know about the windmill <unk> you know and i was just moved i was actually crying during his presentation he was like i try and i make i was like nike should hire him you know just do it  and this is again the point i 'm trying to make when you focus just on the disasters <unk> what is to be done <unk> first of all africans <unk> we need to get better at telling our stories <unk> we heard about that yesterday <unk> we had some of them this morning <unk> and this is an example you know blogging is <unk> doing that afrigator is an aggregator of african blogs that was developed in south africa <unk> so we need to start getting better if no one else will tell our stories <unk> let 's do it and going back to the point i was trying to make this is the swahili wikipedia swahili is spoken by about fifty million people in east africa it only has five contributors <unk> four of them are white males <unk> the other person is ndesanjo if you 're here <unk> stand up is a tanzanian [ the ] first swahili blogger <unk> he 's the only african who 's contributing to this people <unk> please we can 't whine and complain the west is doing this <unk> what are we doing where are the rest of the swahili speakers <unk> why are we not generating our own <unk> 's not enough to complain we need to act <unk> reuters now integrates african blogs into their coverage of africa so that 's a start and we 've heard of all their other initiatives the cheetah generation the aid approach <unk> you know <unk> is flawed <unk> and after all the hoopla of live eight <unk> we 're still not anywhere in the picture no <unk> the point i 'm trying to make though is that it 's not enough for us to criticize <unk> and for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should i be should i move back should i stay <unk> you know  <unk> and i can 't emphasize that enough <unk> you know <unk> i walked away from a job with one of the top firms in d c covington and burling six figures with two paychecks or three paychecks i could solve a lot of my family 's problems <unk> but i walked away from that because my passion was here and because i wanted to do things that were fulfilling <unk> and because i 'm needed here <unk> you know <unk> probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a harvard law school degree because of all the things i 'm doing one is because i 'm pretty aggressive and i try and find you know opportunities but there is such a need you know  i 'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called enablis that supports entrepreneurs in south africa we 're now moving into east africa <unk> and we give them business development <unk> services as well as financing loan and equity i 've also set up a project in kenya <unk> and what we do is we track the performance of kenyan mps my partner m who 's a tech guru hacked wordpress it costs us like <unk> twenty dollars a month just for hosting everything else on there is a labor of love we 've manually entered all the data there and you can get profiles of each mp questions <unk> asked in parliament <unk> we have a comment function where people can ask their mps questions there are some mps who participate and come back and ask  and basically we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians you know <unk> i believe that accountability stems from demand you 're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart <unk> and we as africans need to start challenging our leaders what are they doing <unk> you know they 're not going to change just out of nowhere so we need new policies we need where 's that coming from you know <unk> another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society we talk about african governments like they 've been dropped from mars <unk>  you know <unk>  they come from us <unk> and what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don 't like and how can we change that so mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable  where do we go from here <unk> i believe in the power of ideas i believe in the power of sharing knowledge <unk> and i 'd ask all of you when you leave here <unk>  please just share and keep the ideas that you 've gotten out of here going because it can make a difference the other thing <unk> i want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual i 've had lots of conversations about things i think need to be happening in africa people are like ok if you don 't do aid i 'm a bleeding heart liberal what can i do  and when i talk about my ideas they 're like bbut it 's not scalable <unk> you know give me something i can do with paypal it 's <unk> and sometimes just taking an interest in the individual in the fellows you 've met <unk> and the businesspeople you 've met  it can make a huge difference especially in africa because usually the individual in africa carries a lot of people behind them  practically i mean when i was a first year student in law school <unk> my mom 's business had collapsed so i was supporting her my sister was struggling to get through undergrad <unk> i was helping her pay her tuition  my cousin ran out of school fees and she 's really smart <unk> i was paying her school fees a cousin of mine died of aids left an orphan <unk> so we said well what are we going to do with her <unk>  you know she 's now my baby sister <unk> and because of the opportunities that were afforded to me i am able to lift all those people so don 't underestimate that  an example this man changed my life he 's a professor he 's now at vanderbilt <unk> undergrad professor mitchell seligson <unk>  and because of him i got into harvard law school <unk> because he took an interest i was taking a class of his  and he was just like <unk> this is an overeager student which we don 't normally get in the united states because everyone else is cynical and jaded he called me to his office and <unk> and to me at that time university i was at university of pitts for undergrad <unk> and that was like heaven <unk> ok because compared to what could have been in kenya <unk> and you know <unk> i kind of like pittsburgh like that 's the dumbest reason i 've ever heard for applying to law school <unk> and he took me under his wing and he encouraged me and he said look you can get into harvard you 're that good ok <unk> and if they don 't admit you they 're the ones who are messed up and he built me up you know <unk> and this is just an illustration you can meet other individuals here <unk> just need a push that 's all i needed was a push to go to the next level <unk> basically i want to end with my vision for africa <unk> you know a gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential you know my vision is that <unk> my daughter and any other african child being born today  can be whoever they want to be here <unk> without having to leave <unk> and they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born that 's one thing you americans take for <unk> that you can grow up <unk> you know <unk> not so good circumstances and you can move <unk> just because you are born in rural arkansas whatever that doesn 't define who you are for most africans today <unk> where you live or where you were born and the circumstances under which you were born <unk> determine the rest of your life <unk> i would like to see that change and the change starts with us and as africans we need to take responsibility for our continent
