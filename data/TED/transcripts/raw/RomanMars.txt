 <unk> that guy get to sit down that 's because this is radio  music i tell <unk> and i report on all kinds of stories buildings and toothbrushes <unk> mascots and wayfinding and fonts  my mission is to get people to engage with the design that they care about so they begin to pay attention to all forms of design  when you decode the world with design intent in mind <unk> the world becomes kind of magical <unk> instead of seeing the broken things  you see all the little bits of genius that anonymous designers have sweated over to make our lives better  and that 's essentially the definition of design <unk> making life better and providing joy <unk> and few things give me greater joy than a <unk> kind of obsessed with flags <unk> sometimes i bring up the topic of flags <unk> and people are like  i don 't care about flags and then we start talking about flags and trust me one hundred percent of people care about flags there 's just something about them that works on our emotions  my family wrapped my christmas presents as <unk> including the blue gift bag that 's dressed up as the as the flag of scotland  i put this picture online and sure enough within the first few minutes someone left a comment that said  you can take that scottish saltire and shove it up your ass  laughter see people are passionate about flags you know that 's the way it is what i love about flags is that once you understand the <unk> what makes a good flag what makes a bad flag <unk> you can understand the design of almost anything so what i 'm going to do here is i cracked open an episode of my radio show ninety nine % invisible and i 'm going to reconstruct it here on stage so when i when i press a button over here voice s for sound roman mars it 's going to make a sound <unk> and so whenever you hear a sound or a voice or a piece of music <unk> it 's because i pressed a <unk> that makes it sound weird narrator number one <unk> keep it simple the flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory rm before i moved to chicago in two thousand and five <unk> i didn 't even know cities had their own flags tk most larger cities do have flags rm well i didn 't know that that 's ted kaye by the way tk hello rm he 's a flag expert he 's a totally awesome guy tk i 'm ted <unk> have edited a scholarly journal on flag studies and i am currently involved with the portland flag association and the north american <unk> ted literally wrote the book on flag design narrator good flag <unk> bad flag rm it 's more of a pamphlet really it 's about sixteen pages tk yes it 's called good flag bad flag <unk> how to design <unk> <unk> a great flag rm and that first city flag i discovered in chicago is a beaut <unk> the blue stripes represent the water <unk> the river and the lake narrator the flag 's images colors or pattern should relate to what it symbolizes tk the red stars represent significant events in chicago 's history rm  namely the founding of fort dearborn on the future site of chicago <unk> the great chicago fire  the world columbian exposition which everyone remembers because of the white city <unk> and the century of progress exposition <unk> which no one remembers at all narrator  number three use two to three basic colors tk the basic rule for colors is to use two to three colors from the standard color set <unk> red white blue green yellow and black rm  the design of the chicago flag has complete <unk> municipal building flies the flag whet moser there 's probably at least one store on every block near where i work that sells some sort of chicago flag paraphernalia rm that 's whet moser from chicago <unk> <unk> magazine wm today just for example i went to get a haircut and when i sat down in the barber 's chair there was a chicago flag on the box that the barber kept all his tools in <unk> guy passed me who had a chicago flag badge on his backpack rm it 's adaptable and remixable the six pointed stars in particular show up in all kinds of places wm the coffee i bought the other day had a chicago star on it rm it 's a distinct symbol of chicago pride tk when a police officer or a firefighter dies in chicago <unk> often it 's not the flag of the united states on his casket <unk> it can be the flag of the city of chicago <unk> that 's how deeply the flag has gotten into the civic imagery of chicago rm  and it isn 't just that people love chicago and therefore love the flag i also think that people love chicago more because the flag is so cool tk  a positive feedback loop there between great symbolism <unk> so when i moved back to san francisco in two thousand and eight i researched its flag because i had never seen it in the previous eight years i lived there <unk> and i found it <unk> i am sorry to say sadly lacking <unk> keeping it simple narrator the flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory tk it 's a relatively complex flag rm  ok here we go ok <unk> the main component of the san francisco flag is a phoenix representing the city rising from the ashes after the devastating fires of the 1850s tk  a powerful symbol for san francisco rm i still don 't really dig <unk> it manages to both be too crude and have too many details at the same time <unk> which if you were trying for that you wouldn 't be able to do it <unk>  and it just looks bad at a distance but having deep meaning puts that element in the plus column behind the phoenix <unk> the background is mostly white <unk>  and then it has a substantial gold border around it tk which is a very attractive design element <unk> never use writing of any kind  rm underneath the phoenix there 's a motto on a ribbon that translates to gold in peace <unk> iron in war plus and this is the big problem it says san francisco across the bottom tk if you need to write the name of what you 're representing on <unk> in fact country flags they tend to behave like hats off to south africa and turkey and israel and somalia and japan and gambia <unk> there 's a bunch of really great country flags <unk> but they <unk> obey good design principles because the stakes are high they 're on the international stage <unk> regional flags are another story  there is a scourge of bad flags and they must be stopped  that is the truth and that is the dare the first step is to recognize that we have a problem <unk> people tend to think that good design is just a matter of taste <unk> and quite honestly sometimes it is actually <unk> but sometimes it isn 't all right  here 's the full list of nava flag design principles <unk> four tk no lettering or seals narrator never use writing of any kind tk because you can 't read that at a distance narrator number five tk and be distinctive rm  all the best flags tend to stick to these principles and like i said before most country flags are ok but here 's the thing if you showed this list of principles to any designer of almost anything <unk> they would say these principles <unk> deep meaning having few colors or being thoughtful about colors uniqueness don 't have writing you can 't read all those principles apply to them too  but sadly good design principles are rarely invoked in us city flags <unk> our biggest problem seems to be that fourth one we just can 't stop ourselves from putting our names <unk> on our flags <unk> or little municipal seals with tiny writing on them here 's the thing about municipal seals they were designed to be on pieces of paper <unk> where you can read them not on flags one hundred feet away flapping in the breeze so here 's a bunch of flags again vexillologists call these sobs seals on a bedsheet and if you can 't tell what city they go to yeah <unk> that 's exactly the problem except for anaheim apparently they fixed it  these flags are everywhere in the us <unk> us the european equivalent of the municipal seal is the is the city coat of arms  and this is where we can learn a lesson for how to do things right <unk> so this is the city coat of arms of amsterdam <unk> now if this were a united states city the flag would probably look like this you know yeah  but instead the flag of amsterdam looks <unk> rather than plopping the whole coat of arms on a solid background and writing amsterdam below it they just take the key elements of the escutcheon the shield <unk> and they turn it into the most badass city flag in the world  and because it 's so badass those flags and crosses are found <unk> flags are particularly painful and offensive to me <unk> nothing can quite prepare you for one of the biggest train wrecks in <unk> the city ran a contest and gathered a bunch of submissions with all kinds of designs sk and an alderman by the name of fred steffan cobbled together parts of the submissions to make what is <unk> 's a kitchen sink flag there 's a gigantic gear representing industry there 's a ship recognizing the port a giant stalk of wheat paying homage to the brewing industry <unk> it 's a hot mess <unk>  and steve kodis a graphic designer from milwaukee <unk> wants to change it sk it 's really awful <unk> it 's a misstep on the city <unk> 's behalf to say the least rm but what puts the milwaukee flag over the top <unk> almost to the point of self parody is on it is a picture of the civil war battle flag of the milwaukee regiment  sk so that 's the final element in it that just makes it that much more ridiculous that there is a flag design within <unk> is a fantastic city <unk> i 've been there i love it the most depressing part of this flag though  is that there have been two major redesign contests the last one was held in two thousand and one one hundred and five entries were received tk but in the end the members of the milwaukee arts board decided that none of the new entries were worthy of flying over the city rm  they couldn 't agree to change that thing <unk> you think that good design and democracy just simply do not go together  but steve kotas is going to try one more time to redesign the milwaukee flag sk  i believe milwaukee is a great city every great city deserves a great flag rm steve isn 't ready to reveal his design yet one of the things about proposing <unk> these things is you have to get people on board and then you reveal your design <unk> but here 's the trick  if you want to design a great flag a kick ass flag like chicago 's or dc 's which also has a great flag <unk> start by drawing <unk> <unk> a one by one and a half inch rectangle on a piece of paper your design has to fit within that tiny rectangle here 's why <unk> tk a three by five foot flag on a pole one hundred feet away looks about <unk> rectangle seen about fifteen inches from your eye you 'd be surprised by how compelling and simple the design can be when you hold yourself to that limitation rm meanwhile <unk> back in san francisco is there anything we can do tk  i like to say that in every bad flag there 's a good flag trying to get <unk> the way to make san francisco 's flag a good flag is to take the motto off because you can 't read that at a distance take the name off  and the border might even be made thicker <unk> so it 's more a part of the flag <unk> and i would simply take the phoenix and make it a great big element in the middle of the flag rm  but the current phoenix that 's got to go tk  i would simplify or stylize the phoenix <unk> depict a big wide winged bird coming out of flames <unk> emphasize those flames <unk> this san francisco flag was designed by frank chimero based on ted kaye 's suggestions i don 't know what he would do if we was completely unfettered and didn 't follow those guidelines fans of my radio show and podcast heard me complain about bad flags they 've sent me other suggested designs this one 's by neil mussett  both are so much better  and i think if they were adopted <unk> i would see them around the city <unk> in my crusade to make flags of the world more beautiful  many listeners have taken it upon themselves to redesign their flags and look into the feasibility of getting them officially adopted  music if you see your city flag and like it <unk> fly it <unk> even if it violates a design rule or two <unk> i don 't care <unk>  but if you don 't see your city flag <unk> maybe it doesn 't exist <unk> but maybe it does <unk> and i dare you to join the effort to try to change that  as we move more and more into cities the city flag will become not just a symbol of that city as a place <unk> but also it could become a symbol of how that city considers design itself <unk> especially today as the populace is becoming more design aware and i think design awareness is all time high a well designed flag could be seen as an indicator of how a city considers all of its design systems its public transit  its parks its signage <unk> it might seem frivolous <unk> but it 's not tk  often when city leaders say we have more important things to do than worry about a city <unk> if you had a great city flag you would have a banner for people to rally under to face those more important things rm i 've seen firsthand what a good city flag can do in the case of chicago the marriage of good design and civic pride is something that we need in all places <unk> the best part about municipal flags is that we own them <unk> they are an <unk> when they are done well <unk> they are remixable <unk> adaptable and they are powerful we could control the branding and graphical imagery of our cities with a good flag <unk> but instead <unk> by having bad flags we don 't use we cede that territory to sports teams and chambers of commerce and tourism boards sports teams can leave and break our don 't really care about sports and tourism campaigns can just be cheesy <unk> but a great city flag is something that represents a city to its people and its people <unk> to the world at large <unk> and when that flag is a beautiful thing <unk> that connection is a beautiful thing <unk> so maybe all the city flags can be as inspiring as hong kong or portland or trondheim <unk> and we can do away with all the bad flags like san francisco milwaukee <unk>  cedar rapids <unk> finally when we 're all done we can do something about pocatello idaho considered by the north american vexillological association as the worst city flag in north america that hurts me just to look at thank you so much for listening
