 <unk> a while ago i tried an experiment for one year <unk> i would say yes to all the things that scared me <unk>  anything that made me nervous took me out of my comfort zone <unk> i forced myself to say yes to did i want to speak in public did i want to be on live tv <unk> no <unk> but yes <unk> did i want to try acting no no no but yes yes yes <unk>  and a crazy thing happened <unk> the very act of doing the thing that scared me undid the fear  made it not scary <unk> my fear of public speaking my social anxiety <unk> <unk> but there was one particular yes that affected my life in the most profound way in a way i never imagined <unk> and it started with a question from my toddler  i have these three amazing daughters harper beckett and emerson and emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as honey as though she 's a southern waitress <unk> honey i 'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup  the southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening when i was on my way somewhere and i said yes  and that yes was the beginning of a new way of life for my family <unk>  i made a vow that from now on every time one of my children asks me to play no matter what i 'm doing or where i 'm going i say yes  every single time <unk> time <unk>  almost i 'm not perfect at it but i try hard to practice it and it 's had a magical effect on me <unk> on my children on our family <unk>  but it 's also had a stunning side effect and it wasn 't until recently that i fully understood it that i understood that saying yes to playing with my children likely saved my career <unk>  see i have what most people would <unk> call a dream job <unk> i 'm a writer i imagine i make stuff up for a living dream job <unk> no <unk> i 'm a titan <unk>  dream job <unk>  i create television i executive produce television i make television a great deal of television  in one way or another this tv season i 'm responsible for bringing about seventy hours of programming to the world <unk> four television programs seventy hours of tv <unk> production at a time sometimes four <unk>  each show creates hundreds of jobs that didn 't exist before the budget for one episode of network television can be anywhere from three to six million dollars let 's just say five  a new episode made every nine days times four shows so every nine days that 's twenty million dollars worth of television four television programs seventy hours of tv three shows in production at a time  <unk> seventy hours of tv that 's three hundred and fifty million dollars for a season  in america <unk> my television shows are back to back to back on thursday night around the world my shows air in two hundred and fifty six territories in sixty seven languages for an audience of thirty million people my brain is global  and forty five hours of that seventy hours of tv are shows i personally created and not just produced so on top of everything else i need to <unk> find time <unk> real quiet creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories <unk>  four television programs seventy hours of tv three shows in production at a time sometimes four <unk> three hundred and fifty million dollars campfires burning all over the world <unk>  you know who else is doing that  nobody <unk> so like i said i 'm a titan <unk> i don 't tell you this to impress you i tell you this because i know what you think of when you hear the word writer  i tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard whether you run a company or a country or a classroom or a store or a home <unk>  take me seriously when i talk about working so you 'll get that i don 't peck at a computer and imagine all day  so you 'll hear me when i say that i understand that a dream job is not about <unk> dreaming  it 's all job  all work all reality all blood all sweat no tears i work a lot very hard <unk> and i love it <unk>  when i 'm hard at work when i 'm deep in it there is no other feeling  for me my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air <unk> it is manning the troops it is painting a canvas it is hitting every high note it is running a marathon it is being beyonc and it is all of those things at the same time  i love working <unk>  it is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating and hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal and cruel and judicious <unk> and what makes it all so good is the hum <unk>  there is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets <unk> a hum begins in my brain and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road and i could drive it forever  and a lot of people when i try to explain the hum <unk>  they assume that i 'm talking about the writing <unk> that my writing brings me joy and don 't get me wrong <unk> it does but the hum it wasn 't until i started making television that i started working working and making and building and creating and collaborating that i discovered this thing <unk> this buzz this rush this hum <unk>  the hum is more than writing <unk>  the hum is action and activity the hum is a drug <unk> the hum is music the hum is light and air the hum is god 's whisper right in my ear <unk>  and when you have a hum like that you can 't help but strive for greatness <unk> you can 't help but strive for greatness at any cost <unk> that 's called the hum <unk> or maybe it 's called being a workaholic  maybe it 's called genius maybe it 's called ego maybe it 's just fear of failure <unk>  i don 't know i just know that i 'm not built for failure <unk> and i just know that i love the hum <unk> just know that i want to tell you i 'm a titan and i know that i don 't want to question it <unk> but here 's the thing <unk>  the more successful i become <unk> the more shows the more episodes the more barriers broken <unk> the more work there is to do <unk>  the more balls in the air <unk> the more eyes on me <unk> the more history stares the more expectations <unk> the more i work to be successful <unk> the more i need to work  and what did i say about work <unk> i love working right <unk>  the nation i 'm building the marathon i 'm running the troops the canvas the high note the hum <unk> the hum <unk> the hum <unk>  i like that hum i love that hum <unk> i need that hum <unk> i am that hum <unk>  am i nothing but that hum <unk>  and then the hum stopped <unk> overdone burned out the hum stopped now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working titan <unk> harper tells people my mom won 't be there but you can text my nanny  and emerson says honey <unk> i 'm wanting to go to shondaland  they 're children of a titan they 're baby titans they were twelve three <unk> and one when the hum stopped <unk>  the hum of the engine died i stopped loving work i couldn 't restart the engine the hum would not come back my hum was broken <unk>  i was doing the same things i always did all the same titan work 15 hour days working straight through the weekends no regrets never surrender a titan never sleeps a titan never quits full hearts clear eyes <unk> but there was no hum <unk> inside me was silence <unk>  four television programs seventy hours of tv three shows in production at a time sometimes four four television programs seventy hours of tv three shows in production at a time <unk> <unk> i was the perfect titan  i was a titan you could take home to your mother  all the colors were the same and i was no longer having any fun <unk> and it was <unk> my life  it was all i did i was the hum <unk> and the hum was me <unk>  so what do you do when the thing you do the work you love starts to taste like dust  now i know somebody 's out there thinking cry me a river stupid writer titan lady  but you know <unk> if you make if you work <unk> if you love what you do being a teacher being a banker being a mother being a painter being bill gates <unk> if you simply love another person and that gives you the hum <unk> <unk> if you know the hum <unk> if you know what the hum feels like if you have been to the hum <unk> when the hum stops  <unk> play can i survive in the silence <unk>  and then my southern waitress toddler asks me a question  i 'm on my way out the door i 'm late <unk> and she says momma <unk> wanna play  and i 'm just about to say no when i realize two things one i 'm supposed to say yes to everything and two my southern waitress didn 't call me she 's not calling everyone honey anymore  when did that happen <unk> i 'm missing it <unk> being a titan and mourning my hum and here she is changing right before my eyes  and so she says momma <unk> wanna play and i say yes  there 's nothing special about it we play and we 're joined by her sisters and there 's a lot of laughing and <unk> i give a dramatic reading from the book everybody poops nothing out of the ordinary  and yet <unk>  it is extraordinary because in my pain and my panic in the homelessness of my humlessness i have nothing to do but pay attention  i focus i am still  the nation i 'm <unk> the marathon i 'm running the troops the canvas the high note does not exist  all that exists are sticky fingers and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons and that song about letting go of whatever it is that frozen girl needs to let go of it 's all peace and simplicity  the air is so rare in this place for me that i can barely breathe i can barely believe i 'm breathing play is the opposite of <unk> work  and i am happy something in me loosens a door in my brain swings open  and a rush of energy comes and it 's not instantaneous but it happens <unk> it does happen i feel it  a hum creeps back not at full volume barely there it 's quiet and i have to stay very still to hear it but it is there not the hum <unk> but a hum <unk> and now i feel like i know a very magical secret <unk>  well <unk> let 's not get carried away <unk> it 's just love that 's all it is  no magic <unk> no secret it 's just love it 's just something we forgot  the hum <unk> the work hum the hum of the titan <unk> that 's just a replacement <unk> if i have to ask <unk> you who i am <unk> if i have to tell you who i am if i describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is  i have forgotten what the real hum is  the hum is not power and the hum is not <unk> excited by life the real hum is confidence and peace <unk> the real hum ignores the stare of history and the balls in the air and the expectation and the pressure <unk> the real hum is singular and original <unk>  the real hum is god 's whisper in my ear but maybe god was whispering the wrong words because which one of the gods was telling me i was the titan <unk>  it 's just love <unk> we could all use a little more love <unk> love a lot more love <unk> any time my child asks me to play <unk> i will say yes <unk>  i make it a firm rule for one reason to give myself permission to free me from all of my workaholic guilt <unk>  it 's a law so i don 't have a choice <unk> and i don 't have a choice not if i want to feel the hum <unk> i wish it were that easy but i 'm not good at playing i don 't like it <unk>  i 'm not interested in doing it the way i 'm interested in doing work  the truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face i don 't like playing i work all the time because i like working i like working more than i like being at home facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle because what kind of person likes working more than being at home <unk>  well me i mean <unk> let 's be honest i call myself a titan <unk> i 've got issues  laughter and one of those issues isn 't that i am too relaxed <unk> we run around the yard up and back and up and back we have 30 second dance parties <unk> we sing show tunes we play with balls  i blow bubbles and they pop them <unk> and i feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time  i itch for my cell phone always <unk>  but it is ok <unk> my tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up i <unk> play and i play until i begin to wonder why we ever stop playing in the first place <unk>  you can do it too say yes every time your child asks you to play <unk>  are you thinking that maybe i 'm an idiot in diamond shoes you 're right <unk> but you can still do this you have time <unk>  <unk> you know why because you 're not rihanna and you 're not a muppet your child does not think you 're that interesting  you only need fifteen minutes my two and four year old only ever want to play with me for about fifteen minutes or so before they think to themselves they want to do something else <unk> it 's an amazing fifteen minutes but it 's fifteen minutes if i 'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy i 'm invisible after fifteen minutes  <unk> i can get a 13 year old to talk to me for fifteen minutes i 'm parent of the year  fifteen minutes is all you need i can totally pull off fifteen minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day  uninterrupted is the key <unk> no cell phone no laundry no anything  you have a busy life you have to get dinner on the table you have to force them to bathe but you can do fifteen minutes <unk> my kids are my happy place they 're my world but it doesn 't have to be your kids <unk> the fuel that feeds your hum the place where life feels more good than not good it 's not about playing with your kids <unk> it 's about joy <unk> it 's about playing in general  give yourself the fifteen minutes find what makes you feel good just figure it out and play in that arena <unk> not perfect at it in fact i fail as often as i succeed <unk> seeing friends reading books staring into space  wanna play starts to become shorthand for indulging myself in ways i 'd given up on right around the time i got my first tv show right around the time i became a <unk> right around the time i started competing with myself for ways unknown  fifteen minutes what could be wrong with giving myself my full attention for fifteen minutes <unk> turns out nothing the very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return as if the hum 's engine could only refuel while i was away  work doesn 't work without play <unk>  it takes a little time <unk> but after a few months  one day the floodgates open and there 's a rush <unk> and i find myself standing in my office filled with an unfamiliar melody full on groove <unk> inside me and around me and it sends me spinning with ideas and the humming road is open and i can drive it and drive it and i love working again  but now  i like that hum but i don 't love that hum <unk> i don 't need that hum <unk> i am not that hum that hum is not me <unk> not anymore <unk>  i am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends <unk> i am that hum <unk> hum love 's hum work 's hum is still a piece of me it is just no longer all of me <unk> and i am so grateful <unk>  and i don 't give a crap about being a titan because i have never once seen a titan play red rover red rover <unk> i said yes to less work and more play and somehow i still run my world <unk> my brain is still global my campfires still burn <unk> the more i play <unk> happier i am and the happier my kids are <unk>  the more i play <unk>  the more i feel like a good mother <unk> the more i play the freer my mind becomes the more i play the better i work <unk> the more i play the more i feel the hum <unk>  the nation i 'm building the marathon i 'm running the troops the canvas the high note the hum the hum <unk> the other hum <unk> the real <unk> life 's hum <unk>  the more i feel that hum the more this strange <unk> quivering <unk> uncocooned awkward brand new alive non titan feels like me <unk>  the more i feel that hum the more i know who i am i 'm a writer <unk> i make stuff up i imagine <unk>  that part of the job that 's living the dream <unk> that 's the dream of the job <unk>  because a dream job should be a little bit dreamy i said yes to less work and more play <unk>  titans need not apply <unk> wanna play <unk> thank you
