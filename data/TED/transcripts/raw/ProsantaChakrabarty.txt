 <unk> the study of fishes it looks like a big <unk> boring word  but it 's actually quite exciting because ichthyology is the only ology with yolo <unk> to the cool kids in the audience you already know yolo stands for you only live once  and because i only have one life i 'm going to spend it doing what i always dreamt of doing seeing the hidden wonders of the world and discovering new species <unk> and that 's what i get to do <unk>  now in recent years i really focused on caves for finding new species <unk> and it turns out there 's lots of new cavefish species out there  you just have to know where to look  and to maybe be a little thin <unk> now cavefishes can tell me a lot about biology and geology  they can tell me how the landmasses around them have changed and moved by being stuck in these little holes <unk>  and they can tell me about the evolution of sight <unk> by being blind  now fish have eyes that are essentially the same as ours all vertebrates <unk> and each time a fish species starts to adapt to this dark cold cave environment  over many many generations they lose their eyes and their eyesight until the end up like an eyeless cavefish like this one here <unk>  now <unk> each cavefish species has evolved in a slightly different way <unk>  and each one has a unique geological and biological story to tell us <unk> and that 's why it 's so exciting when we find a new species  so this is a new <unk> its closest relatives are cavefishes in kentucky in the mammoth cave system and they start to diverge when the ohio river split them a few million years ago <unk>  and in that time they developed these subtle differences in the genetic architecture behind their blindness <unk>  there 's this gene called rhodopsin that 's super critical for sight we have it and these species have it too <unk> species has lost all function in that gene and the other one maintains it  so this sets up this beautiful natural experiment where we can look at the genes behind our vision and at the very roots of how we can see <unk>  but the genes in these cavefishes can also tell us about deep geological time maybe no <unk> more so than in this species here this is a new species we described from madagascar that we named that means big sickness in malagasy for how sick we got trying to collect this species <unk>  now <unk> believe it or not <unk> swimming around sinkholes full of dead things and cave full of bat poop isn 't the smartest thing you could be doing with your life despite the fact that it tried to kill us <unk>  and that 's because this species in madagascar its closest relatives are six thousand kilometers away cavefishes in australia  now there 's no way a three inch long freshwater cavefish can swim across the indian ocean  so what we found when we compared the dna of these species is that they 've been separated for more than one hundred million years <unk> or about the time that the southern continents <unk> southern continents were last together  so in fact these species didn 't move at all it 's the continents that moved them  and so they give us through their dna this precise model and measure of how to date and time these ancient geological events  now this species here is so new i 'm not even allowed to tell you its name <unk> can tell you it 's a new species from mexico <unk> and it 's probably already extinct  it 's probably extinct because the only known cave system it 's from was destroyed when a dam was built nearby <unk>  unfortunately for cavefishes their groundwater habitat is also our main source of drinking water <unk>  now <unk> we actually don 't know this species ' closest relative yet it doesn 't appear to be anything else in mexico <unk> so maybe it 's something in cuba <unk> or florida <unk> or india <unk>  but whatever it is it might tell us something new about the geology of the caribbean or the biology of how to better diagnose certain types of blindness <unk>  but i hope we discover this species before it goes extinct too <unk>  and i 'm going to spend my one life as an ichthyologist trying to discover and save these humble little blind cavefishes that can tell us so much about the geology of the planet and the biology of how we see <unk> thank you
