 <unk> in the wake of bin laden 's death have spiked <unk> so those are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six months could have easily been the last six days or the last six years <unk> the point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that <unk> what our minds pay attention to <unk>  and there 's a very good reason for that every second of every day our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains  and because nothing is more important to us than survival the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala  now the amygdala is our early warning detector <unk> our danger detector <unk> it sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us  so given a dozen news stories we will preferentially look at the negative news  and that old newspaper saying if it bleeds it leads is very true  so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week twenty four hours a day <unk> it 's no wonder that we 're pessimistic <unk> 's no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse <unk>  but perhaps that 's not the case <unk> perhaps instead <unk>  it 's the distortions brought to us of what 's really going on  perhaps the tremendous progress we 've made over the last century by a series of forces are in fact accelerating to a point that we have <unk> potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance now i 'm not saying we don 't have our set of problems climate crisis <unk> species extinction water and energy shortage we surely do and as humans we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance <unk>  but ultimately <unk> we knock them down  so let 's look at what this last century has been to see where we 're going  over the last hundred years <unk> the average human lifespan has more than doubled  average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled <unk> childhood mortality has come down a factor of ten <unk>  add to that the <unk> steve pinker has showed us that in fact we 're living during the most peaceful time ever in human history <unk>  and charles kenny that global literacy has gone from twenty five percent to over eighty percent in the last one hundred and thirty years <unk>  we truly are living in an extraordinary time  and many people forget this <unk> and we keep setting our expectations higher and <unk> higher <unk> in fact we redefine what poverty means think of this in america today <unk> the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity water toilets refrigerators television mobile phones <unk> air conditioning and cars <unk>  the wealthiest robber barons of the last century the emperors on this planet could have never dreamed of such luxuries <unk> underpinning much of this is technology and of late <unk> exponentially growing technologies  my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve on moore 's law <unk>  and experiences price performance doubling <unk> that 's why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the ' 70s now look at this curve  this is moore 's law over the last hundred years i want you to notice two things from this curve <unk> number one how smooth it is through good time and bad time war time and peace time recession depression and boom time  this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers <unk> it doesn 't slow for any of our grand challenges <unk>  and also even though it 's plotted on a on a log curve on the left <unk> it 's curving upwards <unk>  the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster  and on this curve riding on moore 's law are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us cloud computing what my friends at autodesk <unk> call infinite computing sensors and networks robotics 3d printing which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet <unk>  synthetic biology <unk> fuels vaccines and foods <unk> digital medicine nanomaterials and a i i mean how many of you saw the winning of jeopardy by ibm 's watson i mean that was epic <unk> in fact i scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper i could and i love this watson vanquishes human opponents  jeopardy 's not an easy game <unk> it 's about the nuance of human language <unk>  and imagine if you would a i ' s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone <unk>  <unk> four years ago here at ted ray kurzweil and i started a new university called singularity university <unk>  and we teach our students all of these technologies and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity 's grand challenges <unk>  and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade <unk>  think about that the fact that literally a group of students can touch the lives <unk> of a billion people today <unk> thirty years ago that would have sounded ludicrous today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that <unk> when i think about creating abundance <unk>  it 's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet <unk> it 's about creating a life of possibility <unk>  <unk> taking that which was scarce and making it abundant you see <unk> scarcity is contextual and technology is a <unk> force let me give you an example <unk> so this is a story of napoleon iii in the <unk> he 's the dude on the left <unk> he invited over to dinner the king of siam  all of napoleon 's troops were fed with silver utensils <unk>  napoleon himself with gold utensils but the king of siam <unk> he was fed with aluminum utensils  you see aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet <unk>  worth more than gold and platinum <unk>  it 's the reason that the tip of the washington monument is made <unk> even though aluminum is eight point three percent of the earth by mass  it doesn 't come as a pure metal <unk> it 's all bound by oxygen and silicates but then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw away mentality <unk> so let 's project this analogy going forward we think <unk> about energy scarcity <unk>  ladies and gentlemen we are on a planet that is bathed with five thousand times more energy than we use in a year <unk>  sixteen terawatts of energy hits the earth 's surface every eighty eight minutes it 's not about being scarce it 's about accessibility <unk> and there 's good news here for the first time this <unk> electricity in india eight point eight rupees versus seventeen rupees the cost of solar dropped fifty percent last year last month mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade  in the sunny parts of the united states <unk> solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to fifteen cents as a national average  and if we have abundant energy we also have abundant water now we talk about water wars do you remember when carl sagan turned the voyager spacecraft back towards the earth in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety after it just passed saturn <unk> he took a famous photo what was it called  a pale blue dot because we live on a water planet <unk> we live on a planet seventy percent covered by water <unk> yes ninety seven point five percent is saltwater two percent is ice and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet <unk>  but here too there is hope <unk> and there is technology coming online not ten twenty years from now <unk> right now  there 's nanotechnology coming on nanomaterials <unk> and the conversation i had <unk> the great diy innovators i 'd like to share with you he gave me permission to do so his technology called slingshot that many of you may have heard of it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator <unk> it 's able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source saltwater polluted water latrine at less than two cents a liter <unk>  the chairman <unk> has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world and if that pans out which i have every confidence it will coca cola will deploy this globally to two hundred and six countries around the planet  this is the kind of innovation empowered by this technology that exists today <unk>  and we 've seen this in cellphones <unk> my goodness we 're going to hit seventy percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of two thousand and thirteen <unk> think about it that a masai warrior on a cellphone <unk> <unk> in the middle of kenya has better mobile comm than president reagan did twenty five years ago <unk>  and if they 're on a smartphone on google they 've got access to more knowledge and information than president clinton did fifteen years ago they 're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted  <unk> that the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for gps <unk> hd video and still images <unk> libraries of books and music <unk> medical diagnostic technology are now literally dematerializing <unk> <unk> and demonetizing into your cellphone <unk>  probably the best part of it is what 's coming down the pike in health <unk> health  last month <unk> i had the pleasure of announcing with qualcomm foundation something called the $ ten million qualcomm tricorder x prize <unk>  we 're challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to because it 's got a i you can cough on it you can do a finger blood prick and to win it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of so literally imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors twenty five percent of the disease burden and one point three percent of the health care workers  when this device sequences an rna or dna virus that it doesn 't recognize <unk> it calls the cdc and prevents the pandemic from happening in the <unk> but here here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance i call it the rising billion  so the white lines here are population <unk> we just passed the seven billion mark on earth <unk> and by the way the biggest protection against a population explosion <unk> is making the world educated and healthy <unk>  <unk> online <unk> connected  by two thousand and twenty that 's going from two billion to five billion internet users  three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation what will these people want what will they consume what will they desire <unk> and rather than having economic shutdown we 're about to have the biggest economic injection ever these people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy <unk>  and they will get healthier by using the tricorder and they 'll become better educated by using the khan academy <unk> and by literally being able to use 3d printing and and infinite computing [ become ] more productive than ever before <unk>  so what could three billion rising healthy educated productive members of humanity bring to us  how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before  what about giving the oppressed <unk> wherever they might be the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever what will these three billion people bring  what about contributions we can 't even predict <unk> the one thing i 've learned <unk> at the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past  let me share and close with a story that really got me excited  there is a program that some of you might have heard of it 's a game called foldit it came out of the university of washington in seattle and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold <unk>  and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality and it 's very important for research in medicine <unk> and up until now it 's been a supercomputer problem <unk>  and this game has been played by university professors and so forth and <unk> people came online and started playing it and it showed that in fact today <unk> the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers <unk>  and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world  it wasn 't an mit professor <unk> it wasn 't a caltech student it was a person from england from manchester a woman who during the day was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and at night was the world 's best protein folder <unk>  ladies and gentlemen what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet <unk>  we have the tools with this <unk> exponential technology <unk> we have the passion of the diy innovator we have the capital of the techno philanthropist and we have three billion new minds coming <unk> <unk> online to work with us to solve the grand challenges to do that which we must do
