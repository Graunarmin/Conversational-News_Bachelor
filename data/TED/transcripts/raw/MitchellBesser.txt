 <unk> want you to take a trip with me  picture yourself driving down a small road in africa <unk> and as you drive along you look off to the side <unk> and this is what you see  you see a field of graves <unk> and you stop and you get out of your car and you take a picture and you go into the town and you inquire what 's going on here and people are initially reluctant to tell you <unk>  and then someone says these are the recent aids deaths in our community  hiv isn 't like other medical conditions <unk> it 's stigmatizing people are reluctant to talk about it there 's a fear associated with it <unk> and i 'm going to talk about hiv today about the deaths about the stigma <unk> a medical story but more than that it 's a social story  this map depicts the global distribution of hiv and as you can see africa has a disproportionate share of the infection  there are thirty three million people living with hiv in the world today  of these <unk> million are living in <unk> there are one point four million pregnant women in low and middle income countries living with hiv and of these <unk> ninety percent are in sub saharan africa <unk>  we talk about things in relative terms and i 'm going to talk about annual pregnancies and hiv positive mothers  the united states a large country each year seven thousand mothers with hiv who give birth to a child  but you go to rwanda a very small <unk> country eight thousand mothers with hiv who are pregnant  and then you go to baragwanath hospital outside of johannesburg in south africa and eight thousand hiv positive pregnant women giving birth a hospital the same as a country and to realize that this is just the tip of an <unk> when you compare everything here to south africa it just pales because in south africa <unk> each year three hundred thousand mothers with hiv give birth to children <unk>  so we talk about pmtct and we refer to pmtct prevention of mother to child transmission <unk> i think there 's an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a <unk> she 's going to infect her child the reality is really very different in resource rich countries with all the tests and treatment we currently have <unk> less than two percent of babies are born <unk> percent of babies are born hiv negative  and yet the reality in <unk> resource poor countries in the absence of tests and treatment forty percent forty percent of children are infected forty percent versus two percent <unk> an enormous difference  so these programs and i 'm going to refer to pmtct though my talk these prevention programs  simply they 're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies  and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children so it 's the test a mother gets when she comes in it 's the drugs she receives to protect the baby that 's inside the uterus and during <unk> it 's the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex <unk> it 's an entire package of services <unk>  and it works  so in the united states since the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s there 's been an 80 percent decline in the number of hiv infected children less than one hundred babies are born with hiv each year in the united states and yet <unk> still <unk> over four hundred thousand children are born every year in the world today with hiv what does that mean it means one thousand one hundred children infected each day one thousand  one hundred children each day infected with hiv and where where do they come from well <unk> less than one comes from the united states  one on average comes from europe  one hundred <unk> come from asia and the pacific and each day a thousand babies a thousand babies are born each day with hiv in africa <unk>  so again i look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of hiv in africa <unk>  and let 's look at another map and here again we see africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors that thin sliver you see here that 's africa <unk> and it 's the same with nurses the truth is sub saharan africa has twenty four percent of the global disease burden and yet only three percent of the world 's health care workers that means doctors and nurses simply don 't have the time to take care of patients  a nurse in a busy clinic will see fifty to one hundred patients in a day <unk>  which leaves her just minutes per patient minutes per patient <unk> and so when we look at these pmtct <unk> programs what does it mean well back in two thousand and one when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug a nurse  in the course of her few minutes with a patient would have to counsel for the hiv test perform the hiv test explain the results dispense a single dose of the drug nevirapine explain how to take it discuss infant feeding options reinforce infant feeding and test <unk> fortunately since two thousand and one we 've got new treatments new tests and we 're far more successful <unk> but we don 't have any more nurses <unk> and so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes it 's not possible it doesn 't work <unk> and so we need to find better ways of providing <unk> is a picture of a maternal health clinic in africa mothers coming pregnant and with their babies these women are here for care <unk>  but we know that just doing a test just giving someone a drug <unk> it 's not enough  meds don 't equal medical care  doctors and nurses <unk> frankly don 't have the time or skills to tell people what to do in ways they understand i 'm a doctor i tell people things to do and <unk> i expect them to follow my guidance because i 'm a doctor i went to harvard but the reality is if i tell a patient you should have safer sex <unk> you should always use a condom and yet in her relationship she 's not empowered what 's going to happen if i tell her to take her medicines every day and yet <unk> no one in the household knows about <unk> it 's just not going to work <unk>  and so we need to do more we need to do it differently we need to do it in ways that are affordable and accessible and can be taken to scale which means it can be done everywhere  so i want to tell you a story i want to take you on a little trip <unk>  imagine yourself if you can you 're a young woman in africa you 're going to the hospital or clinic you go in for a test and you find out that you 're pregnant and you 're delighted and then they give you another test and they tell you <unk> <unk> and you 're devastated and the nurse takes you into a room <unk> and she tells you about the tests and hiv and the medicines you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby <unk> and you hear none of it <unk> all you 're hearing is i 'm going to die <unk> and my baby is going to die and then you 're out on the street <unk>  <unk> and you don 't know where to go and you don 't know who you can talk to because the truth is hiv is so stigmatizing that if you partner your family anyone in your home you 're likely to be thrown out without any means of support  and this this is the face and story of hiv in africa today <unk> but we 're here to talk about possible solutions and some good news and i want to change the story a little <unk> take the same mother and the nurse  after she gives her her test takes her to a room <unk>  the door opens and there 's a room full of mothers mothers with babies <unk> and they 're sitting and they 're talking they 're listening they 're drinking tea they 're having sandwiches <unk>  and she goes inside and woman comes up to her and says welcome to mothers2mothers  have a seat you 're safe here we 're all <unk> going to be okay <unk> you 're going to live your baby is going to <unk> we view mothers as a community 's single greatest resource  mothers take care of the children take care of the home so often the men are gone <unk> they 're working or they 're not part of the household  our organization mothers2mothers enlists women with hiv as care providers <unk>  we bring mothers who have hiv who 've been through these pmtct programs in the very facilities to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team  these mothers we call them mentor mothers  are able to engage women who just like themselves <unk> pregnant with babies have found out about being hiv positive  who need support and education and they support them around the diagnosis and educate them about how to take their medicines how to take care of themselves how to take care of their babies consider if you needed surgery you would want the best possible technical surgeon  right but if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life you 'd like to engage someone someone who 's had the procedure  patients are experts on their own experience and they can share that experience with others this is the medical care that goes <unk> beyond just medicines  so the mothers who work for us they come from the communities in which they work <unk>  they 're hired they 're paid as professional members of the health care teams just like doctors and nurses <unk>  and we open bank accounts for them and they 're paid directly into the accounts <unk> because their money 's protected the men can 't take it away from them they go through two to three weeks of rigorous <unk> now doctors and nurses they too get trained but so often they only get trained once so they 're not aware of new medicines new guidelines as they come out  our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained <unk> and so doctors and nurses they look up to them as experts <unk>  imagine that a woman a former <unk> being able to educate her doctor for the first time and educate the other patients that she 's taking care of  our organization has three goals the first to prevent mother to child transmission <unk>  the second <unk> keep mothers healthy <unk> keep mothers alive keep the children alive no more orphans and the third and maybe the most grand is to find ways to empower women  enable them to fight the stigma and to live <unk> positive and productive lives with hiv <unk>  so how do we do it well <unk> maybe the most important engagement is the one to one  seeing patients one to one educating them <unk> supporting them explaining how they can take care of themselves <unk>  we go beyond that we try to bring in the husbands the partners <unk> in africa it 's very very hard to engage men men are not frequently part of pregnancy care  but in rwanda in one country <unk> they 've got a policy that a woman can 't come for care unless she brings the father of the baby with her that 's the rule <unk>  and so the father and the mother together go through the counseling and the testing the father and the mother together they get the results <unk> and this is so important in breaking through the stigma is so central to prevention how do you have safer sex how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn 't been disclosure  disclosure is so important to treatment <unk> because again people need the support of family members and friends to take their medicines regularly <unk>  we also work in groups now the groups it 's not like me <unk> what happens is women they come together under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers they come together and they share their personal experiences <unk>  and it 's through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves <unk> how to disclose how to take medicines <unk>  and then there 's the community outreach <unk> engaging women in their communities  if we can change the way households believe and think  we can change the way communities believe and think and if we can change enough communities <unk> we can change national attitudes we can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to hiv  the hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction we have the medicines we have the tests <unk> but how do you reduce the stigma  and it 's important about disclosure so  a couple years ago one of the mentor mothers came back and she told me a story  she had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client <unk> client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her hiv status <unk>  and she was afraid to go by herself <unk> and so the mentor mother went along with and the patient walked into the house and said to her to her mother and siblings i have something to tell you i <unk> and everybody was quiet <unk> and then her oldest brother stood up and said  <unk> i too have something to tell you i 'm hiv positive i 've been afraid to tell everybody  and then this older sister stood up and said i too am living with the virus <unk> and i 've been ashamed  and then her younger brother stood up and said i 'm also positive <unk> i thought you were going to throw me out of the family and you see where this is going the last sister stood up and said i 'm also positive i <unk> going to hate me and there they were all of them together for the first time being able to share this experience for the first time and to support each other for the first time female narrator  women come to us and they are crying and scared <unk> i tell them my story <unk> that i am but my child is i tell them you are going to make it <unk> and you will raise a healthy baby <unk> i am proof that there is hope mitchell besser  remember the images i showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in africa <unk>  and it is a crisis in health care systems <unk> even as we have more tests and more drugs <unk> we can 't reach people we don 't have enough providers so we talk in terms of what we call <unk> is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it <unk> it 's a doctor giving a job to a nurse and the issue in africa is that there are fewer nurses really than doctors and so we need to find new paradigm for health care how do you build a better health care system  we 've chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor a nurse and a mentor mother and so what nurses do is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain <unk> take the drugs the side effects they delegate education about infant feeding family planning safer sex <unk>  actions that nurses simple just don 't have time for  so we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission the world is increasingly seeing these programs as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health and our organization helps women across that bridge  the care doesn 't stop when the baby 's born we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby <unk> ensuring that they live healthy successful lives  our organization works on three levels the first at the patient level mothers and babies keeping babies from getting hiv keeping mothers healthy to raise them <unk>  the second communities empowering women  they become leaders within their <unk> they change the way communities think we need to change attitudes to hiv we need to change attitudes to women in africa <unk>  we have to do that <unk> and then rework the level of the health care systems building stronger health care systems our health care systems are broken  they 're not going to work the way they 're currently designed <unk> and so doctors and nurses who need to try to change people 's behaviors don 't have the <unk> don 't have the time our mentor mothers do <unk> and so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in we can do that  i started the program in capetown south africa back in two thousand and one it was at that point just the spark of an idea  referencing steven johnson 's very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from i was in the shower at the time <unk> the program is now working in nine countries <unk> we have six hundred and seventy program sites <unk>  we 're seeing about two hundred and thirty thousand women every month <unk>  we 're employing one thousand six hundred mentor mothers and last year they enrolled three hundred thousand <unk> pregnant women and mothers that is twenty percent of the global hiv positive pregnant women twenty percent of the world what 's extraordinary is how simple the premise is mothers with hiv caring for mothers with hiv <unk>  past patients taking care of present patients and empowerment through employment reducing stigma <unk> pregnant women <unk> all of this is possible if we each contribute to this fight mb  simple solutions to complex problems mothers caring for mothers
