 <unk> i want to talk with you about is really the problem of how does one supply health care in a world in which cost is everything <unk> how do you do that and the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you i want to <unk> suggest to you is one in which you say that in order to treat disease <unk> you have to first know what you 're treating <unk> that 's diagnostics and then you have to do something <unk> the program we 're involved in is something we call diagnostics for all or zero cost diagnostics how do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost <unk> how do you do it <unk>  let me just give you two examples the rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world poor resources a rigorous environment a series of problems light weight and things of this kind and also they 're not so different from the home health care and diagnostic system world <unk>  so the technology i want to talk about is for the third world for the developing world <unk> but it has i think much broader application <unk> because information is so important in the health care system <unk>  so you see two examples here one is a lab that is actually a fairly <unk> high end laboratory in africa <unk>  the second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing <unk> <unk> a table in a market <unk> i don 't know what kind of health care is delivered there <unk> but it 's not really what is probably most efficient <unk> what is our approach <unk> the way in which one typically approaches a problem of lowering cost starting from the perspective of the united states is to take our solution <unk>  and then try to cut cost out of it <unk>  <unk> how you do that you 're not going to start with a $ one hundred thousand instrument and bring it down to no cost it isn 't going to work  so the approach we took was the other way around to ask what is the cheapest possible stuff that you could make a diagnostic system out of and get useful information and add function <unk>  and what we 've chosen is paper what you see here is a prototypic device it 's about a centimeter on the side it 's about the size of a <unk> the lines around the edges are a polymer it 's made of paper and paper of course wicks fluid as you know paper cloth drop wine on the tablecloth <unk> and the wine wicks all over everything <unk> put it on your shirt it ruins the shirt that 's what a hydrophilic surface does so in this device the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it in a drop of in this case urine <unk>  the fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top <unk> the brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine <unk>  the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine <unk> and the combination of those two is a first order shot at a number of useful things that you want  so this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper now how simple can you make the production <unk> why do we choose paper  there 's an example of the same thing on a finger showing you basically what it looks like one reason for using paper is that it 's everywhere we have made these kinds of <unk> <unk> devices using napkins and toilet paper and wraps and all kinds of stuff  <unk> 'll show you in a moment that the stack of paper there would probably hold something like one hundred thousand tests something of that kind <unk>  and then finally a point you don 't think of so much in developed world medicine  it eliminates sharps <unk> and what sharps means is needles things that stick if you 've taken a sample of someone 's blood and the someone might have hepatitis c <unk> you don 't want to make a mistake and stick it in <unk> you don 't want to do that so how do you dispose of that it 's a problem everywhere and here you simply burn it <unk> so it 's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things  now you say if paper is a good idea  other people have surely thought of it and the answer is of course yes <unk>  those half of you roughly who are women at some point may have had a pregnancy test <unk> and the most common of these is in a device that looks like <unk> thing on the left it 's something called a lateral flow immunoassay <unk> in that particular test urine <unk> either containing a hormone called hcg does or does not flow across a piece of paper  and there are two bars one bar indicates that the test is working <unk> and if the second bar shows up you 're pregnant  this is a terrific kind of test in a binary world and the nice thing about pregnancy is either you are pregnant or you 're not pregnant you 're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant or something of that sort <unk>  so it works very well there but it doesn 't work very well when you need more quantitative information  there are also dipsticks <unk> but if you look at the dipsticks they 're for another kind of urine analysis <unk> there are an awful lot of colors and things like that what do you actually do about that in a difficult circumstance <unk>  so the approach we started with is to ask is it really practical to make things of this sort <unk>  and that problem is now in a purely engineering way solved <unk>  and the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper <unk> you run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer <unk>  the wax printer does what looks like printing <unk> you put that on you warm it a little bit the wax prints through so it absorbs into the paper and you end up with the device you want  the printers cost eight hundred bucks now we estimate that if you were to run them twenty four hours a day they 'd make about ten million tests a year <unk> so it 's a solved problem <unk> that particular problem is solved  and there is an example of the kind of thing that you see that 's on a piece of eight by twelve <unk> that takes about two seconds to make and so i regard that as done  there 's a very important issue here <unk> which is that because it 's a printer  a color printer it prints colors that 's what color printers do i 'll show you in a moment that 's actually quite useful  now the next question that you would like to ask is what would you like to measure <unk> what would you like to analyze <unk>  and the thing you 'd most like to analyze we 're a fair distance from it 's what 's called fever of undiagnosed origin someone comes into the clinic they have a fever they feel bad <unk> what do they have do they have tb do they have aids do they have a common cold  the triage problem <unk> that 's a hard problem for reasons i won 't go through there are an awful lot of things that you 'd like to distinguish among <unk>  but then there are a series of things aids <unk> such as guidance of treatment <unk> now even that 's more complicated than you think a friend of mine works in <unk> <unk> psychiatry <unk> and he is interested in the question of why people do and don 't take their meds <unk>  so dapsone or something like that you have to take for a while he has a wonderful story of talking to a villager <unk> what the guy actually meant was that he 'd fed a 30 day dose of dapsone to his dog that morning and he was telling the truth <unk> because in a different culture the dog is a surrogate for you today this month since the rainy season there are lots of <unk> and so an issue here is to in some cases figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting like compliance  now <unk> take a look at what a typical test looks like  prick a finger <unk> you get some blood about fifty microliters that 's about all you 're going to get because you can 't use the usual sort of <unk> you can 't manipulate it very well i 'll show something about that in a moment <unk> so you take the drop of blood no further manipulations you put it on a little device  the device filters out the blood cells lets the serum go through and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there  and the colors indicate <unk> suffering from probably an excess of education what do you do about something which requires quantitative analysis <unk>  and so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there  and at this point there is a dramatic flourish and out comes the universal solution to everything these days which is a cell phone in this particular case a camera phone  they 're everywhere six billion a month in india <unk> and the idea is that what one does is to take the device you dip it <unk> you develop the color you take a picture the picture goes to a central laboratory you don 't have to send out a doctor <unk> you send out somebody who can just take the sample  and in the clinic either a doctor or ideally a computer in this case does the <unk> turns out to work actually quite well <unk> particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work  so my view of the health care worker of the future is not a doctor <unk> but an 18 year old otherwise unemployed who has two things a backpack full of these tests and a lancet to occasionally take a blood sample <unk> and <unk> <unk> and these are the things that get him through his day  there 's another very interesting connection here <unk> and that is <unk> that what one wants to do is pass through useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system  it turns out there 's an enormous amount of information already available on that subject which is the mars rover problem <unk> how do you get back an accurate view of the color on mars if you have a really <unk> terrible bandwidth to do it with  and the answer is not complicated but it 's one which i don 't want to go through here <unk> other than to say that the communication systems for doing this are really pretty well understood <unk>  also a fact which you may not know is that the compute capability of this thing is not so different from the compute capability of your desktop computer this is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped <unk> i don 't know whether the idea of one computer one child makes any sense <unk> computer of the future because this screen is already there and they 're ubiquitous  all right let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices and we 'll start by posing a little problem  what you see here is another centimeter sized device <unk>  and the different colors are different colors of dye <unk>  and you notice something which might strike you as a little bit interesting which is the yellow seems to disappear get through the blue and then get through the red how does that happen how do you make something flow through something  and of course the answer is you don 't you make it flow under and over but now the question is how do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper the answer is that what you do and the details are not terribly important here is to make something more elaborate you take several different layers of paper <unk> each one containing its own little fluid system <unk>  and you separate them by pieces of literally double sided carpet tape <unk> the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor <unk>  and the fluid will flow from one layer into the next <unk> it distributes itself flows through further holes distributes itself <unk> and what you see at the lower <unk> side there is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top <unk>  and it has gone through and distributed itself into these sixteen holes on the bottom in a piece of paper basically it looks like a chip two pieces of paper thick <unk>  and in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that but that is in principle the way you solve the fever of <unk> because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease <unk>  and this will work in due course <unk> here is an example of a slightly more complicated device  there 's the chip <unk> you dip in a corner <unk> the fluid goes into the center <unk> it distributes itself out into these various wells or holes and turns color all done with paper and carpet tape <unk> as we 're likely to be able to come up and make things  now i have two last little stories to tell you in finishing off this business  this is one one of the things you occasionally need to do is separate blood cells from serum <unk>  and the question was here we do it by taking a sample we put it in a <unk> you get blood cells out terrific what happens if you don 't have electricity a centrifuge and whatever <unk>  and we thought for a while of how you might do this and the way in fact you do it is what 's shown here you get an eggbeater  which is everywhere <unk> and you saw off a blade <unk> and then you take tubing and you stick it on that you put the blood in somebody sits there and spins it it works really really well <unk> and we sat down we did the physics of eggbeaters and <unk> tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing and sent it off to a journal we were very proud of this particularly the title which was eggbeater as centrifuge  and we sent it off and by return mail it came back i called up the editor and i said what 's going on how is this possible the editor said  with enormous disdain i read this <unk> and we 're not going to publish it because we only publish science laughter and it 's an important issue because it means that we have to as a society think about what we value and if it 's just papers and phys rev letters we 've got a problem <unk> here is another example of something which is this is a little spectrophotometer <unk> it measures the absorption <unk> light in a sample <unk> the neat thing about this is you have a light source that flickers on and off at about one thousand hertz  another light source that detects that light at one thousand hertz <unk> and so you can run this system in broad daylight  it performs about equivalently to a system that 's on the order of one hundred thousand dollars <unk> it costs fifty dollars <unk> we can probably make it for fifty cents if we put our mind to it <unk> why doesn 't somebody do it <unk> the answer is how do you make a profit in a capitalist system <unk> doing that interesting problem <unk> so let me finish by saying that we 've thought about this as a kind of engineering problem  and we 've asked what is the scientific unifying idea here <unk> and we 've decided we should think about this not so much in terms of cost but in terms of simplicity  simplicity is a neat word you 've got to think about what simplicity means i know what it is but i don 't actually know what it means so i actually was interested enough in this to put together several groups of people the most recent involved a couple of people at mit one of them being an exceptionally bright kid who is one of the very few people i would think of who 's an authentic genius we all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity and i want to give you the answer of <unk> this deep scientific thought
