 <unk> how will we be remembered in two hundred years <unk> i happen to live in a little town princeton in new jersey which every year celebrates the great event in princeton history the battle of princeton <unk>  which was in fact a very important battle it was the first battle that george washington won in fact was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence it happened two hundred and twenty five years ago <unk>  it was actually a terrible disaster for princeton <unk>  the town was burned down it was in the middle of winter <unk> and it was a very very severe winter <unk>  and about a quarter of all the people in princeton died that winter from hunger and cold <unk> but nobody remembers that  what they remember is of course the great triumph that the brits were beaten and we won <unk>  and that that the country was born <unk>  and so i agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered it 's the child that 's remembered <unk> and that 's what we 're going through at this time i wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology <unk> because i think i know very little about that i 'm not a biologist so everything i know about it can be said in one minute  what i 'm saying is that we should follow the model that has been so successful with the electronic <unk> that what really turned computers into a great success in the world as a whole is toys  as soon as computers became toys when kids could come home and play with them  then the the industry really took off <unk> and that has to happen with biotech there 's a huge <unk> who are practical biologists who are dog breeders <unk> pigeon breeders <unk> orchid breeders <unk> rose breeders people who handle biology with their hands <unk> and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things beautiful <unk> these people will be empowered with biotech <unk> and that will be an enormous positive step to acceptance of biotechnology <unk> that will blow away a lot of the opposition <unk> when people have this <unk> buy the software you design it  i won 't say anymore <unk> you can take it on from there  <unk> i think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural becomes part of the human condition  something that everybody 's familiar with and everybody accepts so let 's leave that aside i want to talk about something quite different which is what i know <unk> and that is astronomy and i 'm interested in searching for life in the universe <unk> and it 's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that and that 's what i 'll talk about for ten minutes or whatever the time remains <unk>  the important fact is that most of the real estate that 's accessible <unk> to us i 'm not talking about the stars i 'm talking about the solar system the stuff that 's within reach for spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes most of the real estate is very cold and very far from the sun <unk> if you look at the solar system as we know it today <unk> it has a few planets close to the sun that 's where we <unk> it has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between the orbit of the earth out through to the orbit of jupiter <unk> the asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate but not very large <unk>  and it 's not very promising for life <unk> since most of it consists of rock and metal mostly rock  it 's not only cold but very dry <unk> so the asteroids we don 't have much hope for  there stand some interesting places a little further out  the moons of jupiter and saturn particularly there 's a place called europa which is europa is one of the moons of jupiter  where we see a very <unk> which looks as if it 's floating on top of an ocean <unk> so we believe that on europa there is in fact a deep ocean and that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore  ocean probably the most likely place for life to originate just as it originated on the earth <unk> so we would love to explore europa to go down through the ice <unk> find out who is swimming around in the ocean <unk> whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters whatever there may be that 's exciting or cephalopods <unk>  but that 's hard to do <unk>  unfortunately the ice is thick we don 't know just how thick it is probably miles thick so it 's very expensive and very to go down there send down your submarine or whatever it is and explore that 's something we don 't yet know how to do there are plans to do it <unk> but it 's hard  go out a bit further you 'll find that beyond the orbit of neptune way out far from the sun <unk> <unk> that 's where the real estate really begins you 'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which in what we call the kuiper belt or the oort cloud these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets when they fall close to the sun <unk> mostly they just live out there in the cold of the outer solar system <unk>  but they are biologically very interesting indeed because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals which are just the right ones for developing life so if life could be established out there  it would have all the essentials chemistry and sunlight everything that 's needed  so what i 'm proposing is that there is where we should be looking for life rather than on mars <unk> although mars is <unk> course also a very promising and interesting place but we can look outside very cheaply and in a simple fashion and that 's what i 'm going to talk about there is a imagine that life originated on europa and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years <unk>  it 's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the <unk> surface <unk> just as it did on the earth <unk> staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for two billion years finally came out onto the land <unk>  and then of course it had great much greater freedom <unk>  and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean and the step from the ocean to the land was not easy <unk> <unk> life had originated on europa in the ocean <unk> it could also have moved out onto the surface there wouldn 't have been any air there it 's a vacuum it is out in the cold <unk> but it still could have come <unk> you can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp through cracks in the ice growing on the surface what would they need in order to grow on the surface they 'd need first of all to have a thick skin to protect themselves from losing water through the through the skin <unk>  so they would have to have something like a reptilian skin <unk>  but better what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight the sunlight in jupiter <unk> on the satellites of jupiter is twenty five times fainter than it is here <unk>  since jupiter is five times as far from the sun <unk> so they would have to have these creatures which i call sunflowers <unk> which i imagine living on the surface of europa  would have to have either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight <unk> so they could keep themselves <unk> they would be at a temperature of minus one hundred and fifty which is certainly not favorable for developing life at least of the kind we know <unk>  but if they just simply could grow like leaves little lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight then they could keep warm on the surface <unk>  they could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight and have roots going down into the ocean life <unk> then could flourish much more so why not look of course it 's not very likely that there 's life on the surface of europa <unk> none of these things is likely  but my  my philosophy is look for what 's detectable not for what 's probable there 's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there and i mean the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a <unk> whole this was originally when radio astronomy began <unk> the bell labs <unk> detected radio waves coming from the sky <unk> and the regular astronomers were scornful about this they said <unk> it 's all right <unk> you can detect radio waves from the sun <unk>  but the sun is the only object in the universe that 's close enough and bright enough actually to be detectable <unk>  you can easily calculate that radio waves from the sun are fairly faint <unk> and everything else in the universe is millions of times further away <unk> so it certainly will not be detectable <unk>  <unk> that set back the progress of radio astronomy by about twenty years <unk>  since there was nothing there you might as well not look well  of course as soon as anybody did look <unk> which was after about twenty years <unk>  when radio astronomy really took off because it turned out the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things <unk> brighter than the sun <unk> so the same thing could be true for this kind of life which i 'm talking about on cold objects that it could in fact be very abundant all over the universe <unk> and it 's not been detected just because we haven 't taken the trouble to look so the last thing i want to talk about is how to detect it <unk> something called pit lamping that 's the phrase which i learned from my son george who is there in the audience <unk> you take that 's a canadian expression  if you happen to want to hunt animals at night <unk> you take a miner 's lamp which is a pit lamp <unk>  you strap it onto your forehead <unk> so you can see the reflection in the eyes of the animal so if you go out at night you shine a flashlight <unk> the animals are bright you see the red glow in their eyes <unk> which is the reflection of the flashlight <unk> and then if you 're one of these unsporting characters <unk> you shoot the animals and take them home and of course that spoils the game for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime so in canada <unk> that 's illegal <unk> in new zealand it 's legal because the new zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits because the rabbits compete with the sheep <unk> in new zealand <unk> so the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps  and shine the headlights <unk> and anything that doesn 't look like a sheep you shoot <unk> so i have proposed to apply the same trick to looking for life in the universe that if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces either on europa <unk> or further out  anywhere where you can live on a cold surface those creatures must be provided with reflectors  in order to concentrate sunlight they have to have lenses and mirrors in order to keep themselves warm <unk> and then when you shine sunlight <unk> at them <unk> the sunlight will be reflected back just as it is in the eyes of an animal <unk>  so these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings <unk> and the further out you go in this  away from the sun <unk> the more powerful this reflection will be so actually this method of of hunting for life gets stronger <unk> and stronger as you go further away <unk> because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light shines out even more in contrast against the dark background <unk>  so as you go further away from the sun <unk> this becomes more and more powerful  so in fact you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the earth <unk> why aren 't we doing it simply because nobody thought of it yet  but i hope that we shall look and with any we probably won 't find anything none of these speculations may have any basis in fact <unk> but still <unk> it 's a good chance and of course if it happens it will transform our view of life <unk> it means that the way life can live out there  it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet <unk> it 's extremely hard to move from one planet to another  we 're having great difficulties at the moment and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck especially if you breathe air <unk> it 's very hard to get from planet <unk> if you live in a vacuum if you live on the surface of one of these objects say in the kuiper belt this an object like pluto or one of the smaller <unk> in the neighborhood of pluto <unk>  and you happened if you if you 're living on the surface there and you get knocked off the surface by a collision <unk>  then it doesn 't change anything all that much you still are on a piece of ice <unk>  you can still have sunlight and you can still survive while you 're traveling from one place to another <unk> and then if you run into another <unk> you can stay there and colonize the other object so life will spread then from one object to another <unk> so if it if it exists at all in the kuiper belt <unk>  it 's likely to to be very widespread and you will have then a great competition amongst species darwinian evolution so there 'll be a huge advantage to the species which is able to jump from one place to another without having to wait for a collision <unk> and there 'll be advantages for spreading out <unk> long <unk> sort of kelp like forest of vegetation i call these creatures sunflowers they look like <unk> maybe like sunflowers they have to be all the time pointing toward the sun <unk>  and they will be able to spread out in space because gravity on these objects is weak <unk> so they can collect sunlight from a big area <unk> so they will in fact be quite easy <unk> us to detect
