 <unk> those of you who have seen the film moneyball or have read the book by michael lewis will be familiar with the story of billy beane <unk>  billy was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer all the scouts told him so they told his parents that they predicted that he was going to be a star <unk> but what actually happened when he signed the contract and by the way <unk> he didn 't want to sign that contract he wanted to go to college which is what my mother who actually does love me  said that i should do too and i did well he didn 't do very well <unk> he struggled mightily  he got traded a couple of times he ended up in the minors for most of his career <unk> and he actually ended up in management he ended up as a general manager of the oakland a 's <unk> for many of you in this room <unk> ending up in management which is also what i 've done is seen as a success <unk> i can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the bigs going into management ain 't no success story <unk> it 's a failure  and what i want to talk to you about today and share with you is that our healthcare system our medical system is just as bad at predicting what happens to people in it patients others as those scouts were at predicting what would happen to billy beane <unk> and yet every day thousands of people in this country are diagnosed with preconditions <unk> we hear about pre hypertension we hear about <unk> pretty sure that i diagnosed myself with that in the green room <unk>  we also refer to subclinical conditions there 's subclinical atherosclerosis subclinical hardening of the arteries <unk>  obviously linked to heart attacks potentially  one of my favorites is called subclinical acne <unk>  if you look up subclinical acne <unk> you may find a website which i did which says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat you don 't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation <unk> maybe that 's because you don 't actually have acne <unk>  i have a name for all of these conditions it 's another precondition i call them preposterous <unk> but with a lot of these conditions that actually isn 't the case or at least it isn 't the case all the time <unk> it 's as if there 's a rain delay every single time in many cases <unk>  we have <unk> pre cancerous lesions  which often don 't turn into cancer <unk>  and yet if you take for example subclinical <unk> a bone thinning disease  the precondition <unk> otherwise known as osteopenia <unk> you would have to treat two hundred and seventy women for three years in order to prevent one broken bone  that 's an awful lot of women when you multiply by the number of women who were diagnosed with this osteopenia <unk>  and so is it any wonder given all of the costs and the side effects of the drugs that we 're using to treat these preconditions that every year we 're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet one hundred thousand people a year and that 's a conservative estimate are dying not because of the conditions they have  but because of the treatments that we 're giving them and the complications of those treatments  we 've medicalized everything in this country  women in the audience i have some pretty bad news that you already know <unk> and that 's that every aspect of your life has been medicalized <unk>  strike one is <unk> you hit puberty you now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medicalized it 's a condition <unk> it has to be treated strike two is if you get pregnant that 's been medicalized as well <unk> you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong <unk> strike three is <unk> we all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms for decades until all of a sudden we realized because a study came out a big one nih funded  it said actually a lot of that hormone replacement therapy may be doing more harm than good for many of those women just in case <unk> i don 't want to leave the men out i <unk> after all i have really bad news for all of you in this room <unk> and for everyone listening and watching elsewhere <unk> you all have a universally fatal condition <unk> so just take a moment it 's called pre death  every single one of you has it because you have the risk factor for it <unk> which is being alive <unk>  but i have some good news for you because i 'm a journalist i like to end things in a happy way or <unk> that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk which we 'll see if that happens for everyone you will be a <unk> i made up pre death if i used someone else 's pre death i apologize <unk> i think i made it up i didn <unk> is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who just has a risk factor <unk>  but hasn 't actually had that cancer to call themselves you are a pre vivor  we 've had hbo here this morning i 'm wondering if mark burnett is anywhere in the audience i 'd like to suggest a reality tv show called pre vivor if you develop a disease <unk> you 're off the island <unk> but the problem is we have a system that is completely basically promoted this we 've selected at every point in this system to do what we do <unk> and to give everyone a precondition and then eventually a condition in some cases <unk>  start with the doctor patient relationship doctors <unk> most of them  <unk> they are basically incentivized to do more procedures tests <unk> prescribe medications patients come to them they want to do something we 're americans  <unk> we can 't just stand there we have to do something and so they want a drug <unk> they want a treatment they want to be told this is what you have and this is how you treat it if the doctor doesn 't give you that  <unk> even worse if you are diagnosed with something eventually and the doctor didn 't order that test  you get sued <unk> we have pharmaceutical companies that are constantly trying to expand the indications expand the number of people who are eligible for a given treatment because that obviously helps their bottom line we have advocacy groups like the one that 's come up with pre vivor  who want to make more and more people feel they are at are at risk or might have a condition <unk>  so that they can raise more funds and raise visibility <unk> et cetera <unk> but this isn 't actually <unk> despite what journalists typically do this isn 't actually about blaming particular players <unk> we are all responsible <unk>  i 'm responsible <unk>  i actually root for the yankees i mean talk about rooting for the worst possible offender when it comes to doing everything you can do <unk> thank you <unk> i didn 't have a course called how to think skeptically or how not to order tests <unk> we have this system where that 's what you do <unk> and it actually took being a journalist to understand all these incentives you know economists <unk> like to say there are no bad people there are just bad incentives <unk>  and that 's actually true <unk> because what we 've created is a sort of field of dreams when it comes to medical technology <unk>  so when you put another mri in every corner you put a robot in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery  well <unk> we 've created a system where if you build it they will come <unk> but you can actually perversely <unk> convince them that they have to come it was when i became a journalist that i really realized how i was part of this problem <unk> and how we all are part of this problem <unk>  i was medicalizing every risk factor i was writing stories commissioning stories <unk>  every day that were trying to not necessarily make people worried although that was what often happened  but you know there are ways out i saw my own internist last week <unk> and he said to me <unk> and he told me something that everyone in this audience could have told me for free <unk> but i paid him for the privilege which is that i need to lose some weight <unk>  well <unk> he 's right <unk> i 've had honest to goodness high blood pressure for a dozen years now same age my father got it <unk> and it 's a real disease it 's not pre hypertension it 's actual <unk> or anything like that he didn 't say <unk> better start taking this statin you need to lower your cholesterol no he said go out and lose some weight come back and see me in a bit or just give me a call and let me know how you 're doing
