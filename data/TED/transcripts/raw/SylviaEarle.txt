 <unk> fifty years ago <unk> when i began exploring the ocean <unk> no one not jacques perrin not jacques cousteau or rachel carson imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it  it seemed at that time to be <unk> a sea of eden <unk>  but now we know <unk> and now we are facing paradise lost <unk>  i want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us and to consider why it matters that in fifty years we 've lost actually we 've taken we 've eaten more than ninety percent of the big fish in the sea <unk> why you should care that nearly <unk> half of the coral reefs have disappeared <unk>  why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying <unk>  but it really should concern you it does concern you as well <unk> i 'm haunted by the thought of what ray anderson calls tomorrow <unk> we didn 't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time well now is that time i hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and in so doing secure hope for humankind health to the ocean means health for us and i hope jill tarter 's wish to engage earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe and i hope jill that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet i guess i did  for me as a scientist it all began in <unk> when i first tried scuba <unk> it 's when i first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter <unk>  <unk> i actually love diving at night you see a lot of fish then that you don 't see in the daytime  diving day and night was really easy for me in one thousand nine hundred and seventy when i led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine i had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called jim <unk> six miles offshore and one thousand two hundred and fifty feet down it 's one of my favorite bathing suits since then i 've used about thirty kinds of submarines and i 've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called deep search to design and build systems to access the deep sea <unk> i led a five year national geographic expedition the sustainable seas expeditions <unk> using these little subs <unk> they 're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it and i 'm living proof <unk>  astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air <unk> food water temperature all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea <unk> i heard astronaut joe allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support <unk> system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system  and then he pointed to this and he said  life support system we need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it <unk>  the poet auden said thousands <unk> percent of earth 's water is ocean no blue <unk> no green <unk> if you think the ocean isn 't important <unk> imagine earth without it  mars comes to mind no ocean no life support system <unk>  i gave a talk not so long ago at the world bank and i showed this amazing image of earth and i said there it is the world bank <unk> that 's where all the assets are and we 've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them <unk>  tim worth says the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment with every drop of water you drink every breath you take  you 're connected to the sea <unk> no matter where on earth you <unk> most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea <unk> over time most of the planet 's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there mostly by microbes  the ocean drives climate and weather stabilizes temperature shapes earth 's chemistry  water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain sleet and snow <unk>  and provides home for <unk> of life in the world maybe in the universe <unk> no water <unk> no life <unk> no blue <unk> no green <unk>  yet we have this idea we humans  that the earth all of it the oceans the skies are so vast and so resilient it doesn 't matter what we do to it  that may have been true ten thousand years ago and maybe even one thousand years ago <unk> in the last one hundred especially in the last fifty we 've drawn down the assets the air the water <unk> the wildlife that make our lives possible new technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature the nature of what 's happening <unk> showing us our impact on the earth <unk> i mean first you have to know that you 've got a <unk> in our time we 've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history <unk>  and with knowing comes caring and with caring there 's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us <unk>  but first we have to know  three years ago i met john hanke <unk> who 's the head of google earth and i told him how much i loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously <unk> but i asked him when are you going to finish it you did a great job with the land the dirt what about the water  since then <unk> i 've had the great pleasure of working with the googlers with doer marine with national geographic with dozens of the best institutions <unk> <unk> and scientists around the world <unk> ones that we could enlist to put the ocean in google earth <unk> and as of just this week last monday google earth is now whole  consider this starting right here at the convention center <unk> we can find the nearby aquarium <unk> we can look at where we 're sitting and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium the ocean and california 's four national marine sanctuaries <unk> and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets we can flit over to hawaii and see the real hawaiian islands not just the little bit that pokes through the surface <unk>  but also what 's below to see wait a minute we can go kshhplash right there ha under the <unk> what the whales see we can go explore the other side of the hawaiian islands <unk> we can go actually and swim around on google earth and visit with humpback whales  these are the gentle giants that i 've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater there 's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale <unk>  we can pick up and <unk> fly to the deepest place seven miles down the mariana trench where only two people have ever been imagine that it 's only seven miles but only two people have been there forty nine years ago one way trips are easy <unk> we need new deep diving submarines how about some x prizes for ocean exploration <unk> we need to see deep trenches <unk> the undersea mountains <unk> and understand life in the deep sea  we can now go to the arctic  just ten years ago i stood on the ice at the north pole an ice free arctic ocean may happen in this century <unk>  that 's bad news for the polar bears <unk> that 's bad news for us too <unk> excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global <unk> warming <unk> it 's also changing ocean chemistry making the sea more acidic that 's bad news for coral reefs and <unk> plankton also it 's bad news for us we 're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea <unk> millions of tons of discarded fishing nets <unk>  gear that continues to kill <unk> we 're clogging the ocean <unk> poisoning the planet 's circulatory system and we 're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife all units <unk>  barbarically <unk> we 're killing sharks for shark fin soup <unk>  undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle <unk> the nitrogen cycle <unk> the oxygen cycle <unk> the water cycle our life support system we 're still killing bluefin tuna truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead  all of these parts are part of our life support system <unk>  we kill using long lines with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for fifty miles or more  industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers taking everything in their path <unk>  using google earth you can witness trawlers in china the north sea the gulf of mexico shaking the foundation of our life support system leaving plumes of death in their path <unk>  the next time you dine on sushi or sashimi or swordfish steak or shrimp cocktail whatever wildlife you <unk> to enjoy from the ocean think of the real cost for every pound that goes to market more than ten pounds <unk> even one hundred pounds may be thrown away as bycatch this is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea <unk> this chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from <unk> hundred to two thousand the highest concentrations are in red  in my lifetime <unk> imagine ninety percent of the big fish have been killed <unk> most of the turtles sharks tunas and whales are way down in numbers but there is good news  ten percent of the big fish still remain there are still some blue whales there are still some krill in <unk> antarctica there are a few oysters in chesapeake bay <unk> half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet  there 's still time <unk> but not a lot to turn things around  but business as usual means that in fifty years there may be no coral reefs and no commercial fishing because the fish will simply be gone imagine the ocean without fish imagine what that means to our life support system <unk>  natural systems on the land are in big trouble too <unk> but the problems are more obvious <unk>  and some actions are being taken to protect trees watersheds and wildlife <unk> <unk> with yellowstone national <unk> the united states began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea america ever had  about twelve percent of the land around the world is now protected <unk>  safeguarding biodiversity <unk> providing a carbon sink generating oxygen protecting watersheds  and in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea <unk> national marine <unk> 's another great idea <unk> the good news is that there are now more than four thousand places in the sea around the world that have some kind of protection and you can find them on google earth <unk>  the bad news is that you have to look hard to find them  in the last three years for example the u s protected three hundred and forty thousand square miles of ocean as national monuments <unk> but it only increased from zero point six of one percent to zero point eight of one percent of the ocean protected <unk> globally  protected areas do rebound but it takes a long time to restore <unk> 50 year old rockfish or monkfish sharks or sea bass or 200 year old orange roughy <unk>  we don 't consume <unk> 200 year old cows or chickens  protected areas provide hope that the creatures of ed wilson 's dream of <unk> an encyclopedia of life <unk> or the census of marine life will live not just as a list a photograph  or a paragraph  with scientists around the world i 've been looking at the ninety nine percent of the ocean that is open to fishing and mining and drilling and dumping and whatever to search out hope spots and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future <unk> such as the arctic we have <unk> one chance right now to get it right  or the antarctic where the continent is protected <unk>  but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill whales and fish  sargasso sea 's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed <unk> percent of the land in the galapagos islands is protected <unk> but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing it 's true too in argentina on the patagonian shelf which is now in serious trouble  the high seas where whales tuna and dolphins travel the largest least protected ecosystem on earth <unk>  filled with luminous creatures living in dark waters that average two miles deep  they flash and sparkle <unk> and glow with their own living light there are still places in the sea as pristine as i knew as a child <unk>  the next ten years may be the most important and the next ten thousand years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life to cope with climate change <unk> we need new ways to generate power <unk> we need new ways better ways to cope with poverty <unk> wars and disease <unk> we need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place but nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean our fate and the ocean 's are one <unk> we need to do for the ocean what al gore did for the skies above a global plan of action with a world conservation union the iucn is underway to protect biodiversity to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change  on the high seas and in coastal areas  wherever we can identify critical places new technologies are needed to map photograph and explore the ninety five percent of the ocean that we have yet to see the goal is to protect biodiversity to provide stability and resilience <unk>  we need deep diving subs <unk> new technologies to explore the ocean <unk> we need maybe an expedition a ted at sea that could help figure out the next steps and so i suppose you want to know <unk> i wish you would use all means at your disposal films expeditions the web new submarines and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean <unk> the blue heart of the planet <unk> how much some some say ten percent some say thirty percent you decide how much of your heart do you want to protect  whatever it is a fraction of one percent is not enough  my wish is a big wish but if we can make it happen it can truly change the world <unk> and help ensure the survival of what actually <unk> as it turns out is my favorite species that would be us  for the children of today for tomorrow 's child as never again now is the time
