 <unk> i come from one of the most liberal <unk> tolerant progressive places in the united states seattle washington <unk>  and i grew up with a family of great seattlites <unk> was an artist my father was a college professor <unk>  and i am truly grateful for my upbringing <unk> because i always felt completely comfortable designing my life exactly as i saw fit  and in point of fact i took a a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind when i was nineteen i dropped out of college dropped out kicked out splitting hairs <unk> and i went on the road as a professional french horn player <unk> which was my lifelong dream <unk> i played chamber music all over the united states and europe and i toured for a couple of years with a great jazz guitar player named charlie bird and by the end of my 20s i wound up as a member of the barcelona symphony orchestra in spain <unk> what a great life and you know my parents never complained they supported me all the way through it <unk> dream they used to tell their their neighbors and friends our son <unk> he 's taking a gap decade  and there was however one awkward conversation about my lifestyle that i want to tell you about i was twenty seven  and i was home from barcelona and i was visiting my parents for christmas <unk> and i was cooking dinner with my mother <unk> and we were alone in the kitchen <unk> and she was quiet <unk> too quiet <unk> something was wrong <unk> and so i said mom <unk> what 's on your mind  and she said your dad and i are really worried about you  and i said what i mean what could it be at this point <unk> and she said i want you to be completely honest with me <unk> the truth is i wasn 't really political i was just a french horn player <unk> but i had a bit of an epiphany <unk> and they had detected it and it was causing some confusion you see i had become an enthusiast for capitalism <unk>  <unk> and i want to tell you why that is it stems from a lifelong interest of mine in believe it or not poverty <unk>  see when i was a kid growing up in seattle i remember the first time i saw real poverty we were a lower middle class family <unk> but that 's of course not real poverty that 's not even close  the first time i saw poverty <unk> and poverty 's face was when i was six or seven years old early 1970s and it was like a lot of you kind of a prosaic example kind of trite <unk> it was a picture in the national geographic magazine of a kid who was my age in east africa <unk> and there were flies on his face and a distended belly  and he wasn 't going to make it and i knew that <unk> and i was helpless some of you remember that <unk> not exactly that picture one just like it <unk> it introduced the west to grinding poverty around the world <unk>  well that vision kind of haunted me as i grew up and i and i went to school and i dropped out and dropped in and started my family and i wondered what happened to that kid or to people just like him all over the world <unk>  and so i started to study even though i wasn 't in college i was looking for the answer what happened to the world 's poorest people <unk> gotten better what <unk> and i found the answer <unk> and it changed my life <unk> and i want to share it with you see most americans believe that poverty has gotten worse since we were children since they saw that vision if you ask americans has poverty gotten worse or better around <unk> seventy percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s but here 's the truth here 's the epiphany that i had that changed my thinking  from one thousand nine hundred and seventy until today  the percentage of the world 's population living in starvation levels <unk> living on a dollar a day or less obviously adjusted for inflation that percentage has declined <unk> eighty percent  there 's been an eighty percent decline in the world 's worst poverty since i was a kid and i didn 't even know about it <unk> this my friends that 's a miracle <unk>  that 's something we ought to celebrate <unk> it 's the greatest antipoverty achievement in the history of mankind <unk> and it happened in our lifetimes  so when i learned this i asked what did that what made it possible because if you don 't know why if you want to replicate it and get the next two billion people out of poverty because that 's what we 're talking about since i was a kid two billion of the least of these our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of poverty <unk> i want the next two billion so i 've got to know why <unk>  and i went in search of an answer <unk> and it wasn 't a political answer because i didn 't care <unk> you know what i still don 't care <unk>  i wanted the best answer from mainstream economists <unk> left <unk> right and center and here it is here are the reasons there are five reasons that two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of poverty since i was a kid <unk>  number one <unk> globalization <unk> number two free trade <unk> number three property rights <unk> number <unk> it was the free enterprise system spreading around the world after one thousand nine hundred and seventy that did that now <unk> i 'm not naive  i know that free enterprise isn 't perfect <unk> and i know that free enterprise isn 't everything we need to build a better world but that is great <unk> and that 's beyond politics here 's what i learned <unk> is not just about accumulation  at its best it 's about aspiration which is what so many people on this stage talk about is the aspiration that comes from dreams that are embedded in the free enterprise system and we 've got to share it with more people now  i want to tell you about a second epiphany that 's related to that first one that i think can bring us <unk> not just around the world but right here at home  the best quote i 've ever heard to summarize the thoughts that i 've just given you about pulling people out of poverty is as follows  free markets have created more wealth than any system in history they have lifted billions out of poverty  who said it <unk> it sounds like milton friedman or ronald reagan <unk> barack obama said that why do i know it by heart <unk> because he said it to me <unk>  crazy <unk> and i said hallelujah  but more than that i said what an opportunity you know what i was thinking it was at an event that we were doing on the subject at georgetown university in may of two <unk> solution to the biggest problem facing america today <unk> what it 's coming together around these ideas liberals and conservatives to help people who need us the most  now <unk> i don 't have to tell anybody in this room that we 're in a crisis in america and many countries around the world with political polarization <unk> it 's risen to to critical <unk> an article last year in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals published in the west and it was an article in two thousand and fourteen on political motive asymmetry what 's that that 's what psychologists call the phenomenon of assuming that your ideology is based in love but your opponents ' ideology is based in hate it 's common in world conflict you expect to see this between palestinians and israelis for example <unk> what the authors of this article found was that in america today a majority of republicans and democrats suffer from political motive asymmetry a majority of people in our country today who are <unk> <unk> politically active believe that they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate <unk> think about it <unk> think about it <unk> most people are walking around saying you know my ideology is based on basic benevolence i want to help people but the other guys they 're evil and out to get me  you can 't progress as a society when you have this kind of asymmetry it 's impossible  how do we solve it well <unk>  <unk> let 's be honest there are differences <unk> let 's not minimize the differences that would be really nave  there 's a lot of good research on this a veteran of the ted stage is my friend jonathan haidt he 's a psychology professor at new york university he does work on the <unk> <unk> ideology and values and morals of different people to see how they differ <unk>  has shown that liberals care about poverty fifty nine percent more than they care about economic liberty  and conservatives care about economic liberty twenty eight percent more than they care about poverty <unk>  irreconcilable differences right we 'll never come together <unk> wrong <unk>  that is diversity in which lies our strength remember what pulled <unk> up the poor <unk> it was the obsession with poverty <unk> accompanied by the method of economic freedom spreading around the world <unk> we need each other in other words if we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty <unk> there 's no other way  hmm how are we going to get that it 's a tricky thing <unk> we need innovative thinking a lot of it 's on this stage social entrepreneurship <unk> yeah <unk> absolutely phenomenal  we need investment overseas in a sustainable responsible ethical and moral way <unk> yes yes <unk> but you know what we really need  we need a new day in flexible <unk> you ever feel like your own ideology is starting to get predictable <unk> kinda conventional do you ever feel like you 're always listening to people who agree with you  why is that dangerous <unk> because when we talk in this country about economics on the right conservatives you 're always talking about taxes and regulations and big government and on the left <unk> liberals you 're talking about economics it 's always about income inequality right <unk> now those are important things really important to me really important to you but when it comes to lifting people up who are starving and need us today <unk> those are distractions <unk>  we need to come together around the best ways to mitigate poverty using the best tools at our disposal and that comes only <unk> when conservatives recognize that they need liberals and their obsession with poverty and liberals need conservatives and their obsession with free markets that 's the diversity in which lies the future strength of this country if we choose to take it <unk>  so how are we going to do it <unk> how are we going to do it <unk> i 've got to have some action items not just for you but for me <unk>  number one <unk>  action item number one <unk> remember <unk> it 's not good enough just to tolerate people who disagree it 's not good enough  we have to remember that we need people who disagree with us because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these tools <unk> now <unk> what are you going to do how are you going to express that where does this start it starts here <unk> this room we 're blessed we 're blessed with people who listen to us we 're blessed with prosperity we 're blessed with leadership when people hear us with the kind of unpredictable ideology then maybe people will listen <unk> maybe progress will start at that point that 's number one number two <unk> number two <unk> i 'm asking you and i 'm asking me to be the person specifically who blurs the lines who is ambiguous who is hard to classify <unk>  if you 're a conservative be the conservative who is always going on about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor <unk> and if you 're a liberal  be a liberal who is always talking about the beauty of free markets to solve our problems when we use them responsibly if we do that we get two things <unk> number one <unk> we get to start to work on the next two billion and be the solution that we 've seen so much of in the past and we need to see more of in the future that 's what we get and the second is that we might just be able to take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we 're suffering under in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect <unk> and then maybe just maybe we 'll all realize that our big differences aren 't really that big after all thank you
