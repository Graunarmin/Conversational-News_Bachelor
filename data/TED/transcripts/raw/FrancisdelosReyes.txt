 <unk> am an engineering professor <unk> and for the past fourteen years i 've been teaching crap not that i 'm a bad teacher <unk> but i 've been studying and teaching about human waste and how waste is conveyed through these wastewater treatment <unk> plants and how we engineer and design these treatment plants so that we can protect surface water like rivers <unk> i 've based my scientific career on using leading edge molecular techniques dna and rna based methods to look at microbial populations in biological reactors <unk> and again to optimize these <unk> and over the years i have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets and i 've been known to sneak into toilets and take my camera phone all over the world <unk>  but along along the way i 've learned that it 's not just the technical side but there 's also this thing called the culture of crap <unk>  so for example <unk> how many of you are washers and how many of you are wipers if well <unk> i guess you know what i mean  if you 're a washer then you use water for anal cleansing that 's the technical term <unk> and if you 're a wiper <unk> then you use toilet paper or in some regions of the world where it 's not available <unk> newspaper or rags or corncobs and this is not just a a piece of trivia <unk> but it 's really important to understand and solve the sanitation problem <unk> and it is a big problem <unk>  there are two point five billion people in the world who don 't have access to adequate sanitation for them there 's no modern toilet <unk>  and there are one point one billion people whose toilets are the streets or river banks or open <unk> spaces <unk> and again the technical term for that is open defecation <unk> but that is really simply shitting in the open <unk>  and if you 're living in fecal material and it 's surrounding you you 're going to get sick it 's going to get into your drinking water into your food into your immediate surroundings  so the united nations estimates that every year there are one point five million child deaths because of inadequate sanitation  that 's one preventable death every twenty seconds one hundred and seventy one every hour four thousand one hundred every day <unk> and so to avoid open defecation <unk> municipalities and cities build infrastructure for example like <unk> they 've built tens of thousands of these pit latrines <unk> but there 's a problem when you scale up to tens of thousands and the problem is what happens when the pits are full this is what happens  people defecate around the toilet  in schools children defecate on the floors and then leave a trail outside the building and start defecating around the building  and these <unk> pits have to be cleaned and manually emptied and who does the emptying you 've got these workers who have to sometimes go down into the pits and manually remove the contents it 's a dirty and dangerous business as you can see there 's no protective equipment no protective clothing <unk> there 's one worker down there i hope you can see him he 's got a face mask on but no shirt <unk>  and in some countries like india the lower castes are condemned to empty the pits and they 're further condemned by society <unk>  so you ask yourself how can we solve this and why don 't we just build western style flush toilets for these two and a half billion  and the answer is it 's just not possible in some of these areas there 's not enough water there 's no energy <unk> energy it 's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars to lay out the sewer lines and to build the facilities and to operate and maintain these systems <unk>  and if you don 't build it right you 're going to have flush toilets that basically go straight into the river just like what 's happening in many cities in the developing world  and is this really the solution <unk> because essentially what you 're doing is you 're using clean water and you 're using it to flush <unk> toilet <unk>  convey it to a wastewater treatment plant which then discharges to a river <unk> and that river <unk> again is a drinking water source <unk> so we 've got to rethink sanitation and we 've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure <unk> and i 'm going to argue that to do this you have to employ systems thinking we have to look at the whole <unk> we start with a human interface <unk>  and then we have to think about how feces are collected and stored <unk> transported  treated and reused and not just disposal but reuse so let 's start with the human user interface  i say it doesn 't matter if you 're a washer or a wiper  a sitter or a squatter the human user interface should be clean and easy to use because after all taking a dump should be pleasurable and when we open the possibilities to understanding this sanitation chain then the back end technology the collection to the reuse  should not really matter and then we can apply locally adoptable and <unk> context sensitive solutions so we can open ourselves to possibilities <unk> and there 's two holes in this toilet <unk> there 's the front and the back and the front collects the urine <unk> and the back collects the fecal material and so what you 're doing is you 're separating the urine which has eighty percent of the nitrogen and fifty percent of the phosphorus <unk>  and then that can then be treated and precipitated to form things like struvite which is a high value fertilizer <unk> and then the fecal material can then be disinfected and again converted to <unk> example in some of our research  you can reuse the water by treating it in on site sanitation systems like planter boxes or constructed wetlands <unk> so we can open up all these possibilities <unk> if we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets and treatment plants  <unk> i 'm going to argue that governments should fund sanitation infrastructure ngos and donor organizations  they can do their best but it 's not going to be enough governments should fund sanitation the same way they fund roads and schools and hospitals and other infrastructure like bridges because we know <unk> and the who has done this study that for every dollar that we invest in sanitation infrastructure we get something like three to thirty four dollars back let 's go back to the problem of pit emptying <unk> so at north carolina state university we challenged our students to come up with a simple solution <unk>  and this is what they came up with a simple modified screw auger that can move the waste up from the pit and into a collecting drum <unk> and now the pit worker doesn 't have to go down into the pit we tested it in south africa and it works we need to make it more robust and we 're going to do more testing in malawi and south africa this coming year <unk>  and our idea is to make this a professionalized pit emptying service so that we can create a small business out of it create profits and jobs <unk> and the hope is that as we are rethinking sanitation  we are extending the life of these pits so that we don 't have to resort to quick solutions that don 't really make sense i believe that access to adequate sanitation is a basic human right <unk>  we need to stop the practice of lower castes and lower status people going down and being condemned to empty pits  it is our moral it is our social and our environmental obligation thank you
