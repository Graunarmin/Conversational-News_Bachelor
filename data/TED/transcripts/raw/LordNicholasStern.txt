 <unk> a remarkable moment in time <unk> we face over the next two decades two fundamental transformations that will determine whether the next one hundred years is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries <unk> let me illustrate with an example i first visited beijing twenty five years ago to teach at the people 's university of china  china was getting serious about market economics and about university education so they decided to call in the foreign experts <unk> like most other people i moved around beijing <unk> from dodging the occasional vehicle it was a safe and easy way to get around  cycling in beijing now is a completely different prospect <unk> the roads are jammed by cars and trucks the air is dangerously polluted from the burning of coal and diesel <unk> when i was there last in the spring there was an advisory for people of my age <unk> to stay indoors and not move much how did this come about it came from the way in which beijing has grown as a city <unk>  it 's doubled over those twenty five years more than doubled from ten million to twenty million <unk> it 's become a sprawling urban area dependent on dirty fuel dirty energy particularly coal  china burns half the world 's coal each year <unk> and that 's why it is a key reason why it is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases  at the same time <unk> we have to recognize that in that period china has grown remarkably  it has become the world 's second largest economy <unk> hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty  that 's really <unk> the same time the people of china are asking the question what 's the value of this growth if our cities are unlivable  they 've analyzed <unk> diagnosed that this is an unsustainable path of growth and development  china 's planning to scale back coal <unk> it 's looking to build its cities in different ways  now the growth of china is part of a dramatic change fundamental change in the structure of the world economy  just twenty five years ago <unk> the developing countries the poorer countries of the world were  notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people they accounted for only about a third of the world 's output <unk>  now it 's more than half twenty five years from now it will probably be two thirds from <unk> the countries that we saw twenty five years ago as developing that 's a remarkable change <unk> it means that most countries around the world <unk> rich or poor are going to be facing the two fundamental transformations that i want to talk about and highlight now the first of these transformations is the basic structural change of the economies and societies that i 've already begun to illustrate through the <unk> percent now in urban areas that 's going to go to seventy percent in two thousand and fifty  over the next two decades we 'll see the demand for energy rise by forty percent and the growth in the economy and in the population is putting increasing pressure on our land on our water and on our forests  <unk> structural change if we manage it in a negligent or a shortsighted way  we will create waste pollution <unk>  congestion <unk> destruction of land and forests <unk> if we think of those three areas that i have illustrated with my numbers cities <unk>  energy land if we manage all that badly <unk> then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods <unk> the people around the world would be poor and damaged and more than that the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise  with immense risks to our climate concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are already higher than they 've been for millions of years <unk> if we go on increasing those <unk> we risk temperatures over the next century or so that we have not seen on this planet for tens of millions of years  we 've been around as homo sapiens that 's a rather generous definition sapiens for perhaps a quarter of a million years a quarter of a million <unk> we risk temperatures we haven 't seen for tens of millions of years over a century  that would transform the relationship between human beings and the planet it <unk> would lead to changing deserts <unk> changing rivers changing patterns of hurricanes changing sea levels hundreds of millions of people  perhaps billions of people who would have to move and if we 've learned anything from history <unk> that means severe and extended conflict <unk> and we couldn 't just turn it <unk> you can 't make a peace treaty with the planet you can 't negotiate with the laws of physics you 're in there you 're stuck  those are the stakes we 're playing for and that 's why we have to make this second transformation <unk> the climate transformation <unk> and move to a low carbon economy <unk>  now the first of these transformations is going to happen anyway <unk> we have to decide whether to do it well or badly the economic or structural transformation but the second of the transformations <unk> the climate transformations we have to decide to do  those two transformations face us in the next two decades the next two decades are decisive for what we have to do  now the more i 've thought about this the two transformations coming together <unk> the more i 've come to realize that this is an enormous opportunity it 's an opportunity which we can use <unk> an opportunity which we can lose <unk>  and let me explain through those three key areas that i 've identified cities <unk> energy and land and let me start with cities  i 've already described the problems of beijing <unk>  pollution <unk> congestion waste and so on surely we recognize that in many of our cities around the world now with cities <unk> like life but particularly <unk> you have to think ahead <unk> the cities that are going to be built and there are many <unk> and many big ones we have to think of how to design them in a compact way so we can save travel time and we can save energy <unk> the cities that already are there well established  we have to think about renewal and investment in them so that we can connect ourselves much better within those cities <unk> and make it easier encourage more people to live closer to the center <unk>  <unk> examples building around the world of the kinds of ways in which we can do that  the bus rapid transport system in bogot in colombia is a very important case of how to move around safely and quickly in a non polluting way in a city very frequent buses strongly protected routes the same service really as an <unk> railway system but much much cheaper and can be done much more quickly a brilliant idea in many more cities around the world that 's developing <unk> now <unk> some things in cities do take time some things in cities can happen much more quickly <unk>  take my hometown london  in one thousand nine hundred and fifty two smog in london killed four thousand people and badly damaged the lives of many many more and <unk> those of you live outside london in the u k will remember it used to be called the smoke <unk>  that 's the way london was by regulating coal within a few years the problems of smog were rapidly reduced i remember the smogs well <unk> when the visibility dropped to [ less ] than a few meters they stopped the buses and i had to walk <unk> but it was changed it was changed by a decision  good decisions can bring good results <unk>  striking results quickly <unk> we 've seen more in london we 've introduced the congestion charge actually quite quickly and effectively <unk>  and we 've seen great improvements in the bus system <unk> and cleaned up the bus system <unk> you can see that the two transformations i 've described the structural and the climate <unk> come very much together <unk> but we have to invest we have to invest in our cities and we have to invest wisely <unk> and if we do we 'll see cleaner cities <unk> quieter cities <unk> safer cities more attractive cities <unk> more productive cities <unk> and stronger community in those cities public transport recycling reusing all sorts of things that bring communities together <unk> we can do that but we have to think we have to invest we have to plan let me turn to energy  now energy over the last twenty five years has increased by about fifty percent eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels over the next twenty years <unk>  perhaps it will increase by another forty percent or so  we have to invest strongly in energy <unk> we have to use it much more efficiently <unk> and we have to make it clean we can see how to do that take the example of california it would be in the top ten countries in the world if it was independent around twenty percent in renewables wind solar and so on to over thirty three percent and that would bring california back to greenhouse gas emissions <unk> <unk> in two thousand and twenty to where they were in one thousand nine hundred and ninety a period when the economy in california would more or less have doubled <unk> that 's a striking achievement it shows what can be done not just california the incoming government of india is planning to get <unk> solar technology to light up the homes of four hundred million people who don 't have electricity in india they 've set themselves a target of five years <unk>  i think they 've got a good chance of doing that we 'll see but what you 're seeing now is people moving much more quickly four hundred million more than the population of the united states those are the kinds of ambitions now people are setting themselves in terms <unk> of rapidity of of change <unk> again you can see good decisions can bring quick results <unk> and those two transformations the economy and the structure and the climate and the low carbon are intimately intertwined do the first one well the structural the second one on the climate becomes <unk> look at land land and particularly forests forests are the hosts to valuable plant and animal species they hold water in the soil and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere fundamental to the tackling of climate change <unk> but we 're losing our forests in the last decade <unk> we 've lost a forest area the size of portugal and much more has been degraded but we 're already seeing that we can do so much about that we can recognize the problem but we can also understand how to tackle it  in brazil the rate of deforestation has been reduced by seventy percent over the last ten years <unk>  how by involving local communities investing in their agriculture and their economies by monitoring more carefully by enforcing the <unk> law more strictly  and it 's not just stopping deforestation that 's of course of first and fundamental importance  but it 's also regrading degraded land regenerating rehabilitating degraded land <unk>  i first went to ethiopia in <unk> it was desperately <unk> in the following years it suffered devastating famines and profoundly destructive social conflict over the last few years <unk> actually more than a few  ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly it has ambitions to be a middle income country fifteen years from now and to be carbon neutral <unk> again i think it 's a strong ambition but it is a plausible one <unk> you 're seeing that commitment there you 're seeing what can be done ethiopia is investing in clean energy it <unk> working in the rehabilitation of land  in humbo in southwest ethiopia a wonderful project to plant trees on degraded land and work with local communities on sustainable forest <unk> <unk> management has led to big increases in living standards so we can see  <unk> from california to india from brazil to ethiopia we do understand how to manage those two transformations <unk> the structural and the climate <unk> we do understand how to manage those well <unk>  and technology is changing very rapidly <unk> i don 't have to list all those things to an audience like this but you can see the electric cars <unk> you can see the batteries using new materials you can see that we can manage remotely now our household appliances on our mobile phones when we 're away you can see better insulation and there 's much more coming  but and it 's a big but  the world as a whole is moving far too slowly  we 're not cutting emissions in the way we should we 're not managing those structural transformations as we can <unk> the depth of understanding of the immense risks of climate change <unk> change are not there yet <unk>  the depth of understanding of the attractiveness of what we can do is not there yet <unk>  we need political pressure to build <unk> we need leaders to step up we can have better growth better climate a better world we can make by managing those two transformations well the next one hundred years the best of centuries <unk>  if we make a mess of it we you and me if we make a mess of it if we don 't manage those transformations properly it will be the next one hundred years will be the worst of centuries <unk> that 's the major conclusion of the report on the economy and climate chaired by <unk> ex president felipe caldern of mexico and i co chaired that with him <unk> and we handed that report yesterday here in new york in the united nations building to the secretary general of the <unk> we know that we can do this <unk> our daughter gave birth to rosa here in new york two weeks ago <unk> here are <unk> two weeks old  are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we understood the issues that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities <unk> and still we failed to act <unk> let 's make the next one hundred years the best of centuries
