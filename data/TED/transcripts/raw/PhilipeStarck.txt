 <unk> you will understand nothing with my type of english it 's good for you because <unk> you can can have a break after all these fantastic <unk> all the other guys <unk> i feel like shit <unk>  <unk> i don 't know why i am here but <unk> you know the nightmare you can have like you are an impostor <unk> you arrive at the opera and they push you  you must sing  i don 't know  laughter so so because i have nothing to show nothing <unk> we shall try to speak about something else we can start <unk> if you want by understanding it 's just to start it 's not interesting but how i work when somebody comes to me and ask for what i am known a toothbrush  i don 't try to design the toothbrush i don 't try to say oh that will be a beautiful object or something like that <unk> that doesn 't interest me because there is different types of design  the one we can call it the cynical design <unk> that means the design invented by <unk> which is terrible it means the design must be just the weapon for marketing for producer to make product more sexy like that they sell more <unk> there is people like me who try to deserve to exist <unk>  and who are so ashamed to make this useless job who try to do it in <unk> make the object for the object but for the result for the profit profit for the human being the person who will use it if we take the toothbrush <unk> i don 't think about owns this mouth <unk> what is the life of the owner of this mouth <unk>  in what society [ does ] this guy live what civilization creates this society <unk> what animal species creates this civilization when i arrive and i take one <unk> so intelligent when i arrive at the level of animal species that becomes real interesting me i have strictly no power to change anything <unk> <unk> but when i come back <unk> i can understand why i shall not do it because today <unk> there is things to see <unk> there is things to see <unk> there is the big challenge <unk> the big challenge in front of us <unk> because there is not a human production which exists outside of what i call the big image the big image is our story <unk>  <unk> our mutation our life <unk> we must remember <unk> and we can see that in any book of my son of ten years old <unk>  that life appears four billion years ago around four billion point two <unk> first soup bloop bloop bloop sort of dirty mud no life nothing <unk> we copy our way to reproduce you know what i mean <unk> and something of <unk> we become a monkey after we become what we are today we know and especially carolyn knows that when the sun will implode <unk>  the earth will burn explode i don 't know what and this is scheduled for four four billion years <unk>  yes she said something like that <unk> ok <unk> that means we are at half of <unk> it 's a beauty can you imagine it 's very symbolic <unk> because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today <unk> and today <unk> we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years <unk>  and this territory is fantastic <unk> that is our poetry <unk> that is our our beautiful story <unk> we don 't deeply understand if we don 't integrate that we are mutants <unk> we completely miss the story <unk> because every generation thinks we are the final one we have a way to look at earth like that you know i am the man the final man you know  <unk> i am not sure of that because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that there is so many <unk> is obliged to be a genius <unk>  but everybody is obliged to participate <unk>  and to participate <unk> for a mutant <unk> there is a minimum of exercise a minimum of sport <unk> we can say that  the first <unk> if you want there is so many but one which is very easy to do is the duty of vision <unk> i can explain you i shall try <unk> if you walk like that it 's ok it 's ok <unk> you can walk but perhaps <unk> because you walk with the eyes like that <unk> you will not see oh there is a hole <unk> and you will <unk> and you will die dangerous <unk> that 's why perhaps you will try to have this angle of vision <unk> ok <unk> i can see if i found something up up <unk>  and they continue up up up <unk> i raise the angle of vision <unk> but it 's still very selfish <unk> of your eyes a little more you go i see you oh my god you are here how are you i can help you <unk>  i can design for you a new toothbrush <unk> new toilet brush something like that <unk> i live in society <unk> i live in community <unk> it 's ok <unk> this level the more you can raise this angle of view the more you will be important for the society the more you will rise the more you will be important for the civilization the more you will rise to see far and <unk> like that the more you will be important for the story of our mutation <unk> that means intelligent people are in this angle <unk> that is intelligence <unk> from this to here that <unk> it 's genius ptolemy <unk> eratosthenes <unk> einstein things like that <unk> nobody 's obliged to be a genius it 's better but nobody  take care in this <unk> be a good mutant there is some danger there is some trap one trap the vertical <unk> because at the vertical of us <unk> if you look like that <unk> come back because after there is another trap <unk> if you look like that <unk> you look to the past <unk> or you look inside if you are very flexible inside yourself <unk> it 's called schizophrenia <unk> and you are dead also <unk>  that 's why every morning now <unk> because you are <unk> mutant you will raise your angle of view <unk>  out more of the horizontal you are an intelligence never forget like that we if we look from far we see our line of evolution  this line of evolution is clearly positive from far this line looks very smooth <unk> like that <unk> but if you <unk> we can say light is civilization shadow is barbaria <unk>  and it 's very important to know where we are <unk> because some some cycle <unk> there is a spot in the cycle <unk> and <unk> i don 't say it was fantastic <unk> but in the ' 80s there was not too much war <unk> like that it was we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized in this case people like me are acceptable <unk> we can say <unk> say it 's luxurious time we have time to think we have time to i don 't know what speak about art and things like that <unk> it 's ok <unk>  we are in the light but sometimes <unk> like today <unk>  we fall we fall so fast so fast to shadow <unk> we fall so fast to barbaria <unk> many face of barbaria because it 's not the barbaria we have today <unk> it 's perhaps not the barbaria we think <unk> there is different type of barbaria <unk> that 's why <unk> even i 'm sorry to say forget art forget all that <unk> there is priority <unk> there is urgency <unk> you must go back to politics <unk> you must go back to radicalization <unk> i 'm sorry if <unk> that 's not very english <unk> you must go back to fight to battle <unk> that 's why today i 'm so ashamed to make this job <unk> that 's why i am here to try to do it the best possible but i know that even i do it the best possible because it 's not the right time <unk> that 's why i say that i say that <unk>  because i repeat nothing exist if it 's not in the good reason <unk> the reason of our <unk> but there is so many different other scenarios of other <unk> idea we have invented this concept of god we are god now  we are it 's almost done <unk> we have just to finish the story <unk>  that is very very important and when you don 't understand really what 's happened <unk> you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that back <unk> back <unk> back <unk> back like that <unk> and you can fall <unk> and it 's very dangerous <unk> no you must really understand that
