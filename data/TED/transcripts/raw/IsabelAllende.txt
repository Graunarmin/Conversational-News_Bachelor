 <unk> thank you so much it 's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart <unk>  i 'm here to tell you a few tales of passion <unk> there 's a jewish saying that <unk> i want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity  all stories interest me and some haunt me until i end up writing them  certain themes keep coming up i 'm aware of the mystery around us so i write about coincidences premonitions emotions <unk> dreams the power of nature <unk> magic  in the last twenty years i have published a few books <unk> but i have lived in anonymity until february of two thousand and six when i carried the olympic flag in the winter olympics in italy that made me a celebrity <unk> now people recognize me in macy 's and my grandchildren think that i 'm cool  allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame  one of the organizers of the olympic ceremony of the opening ceremony <unk> called me and said that i had been selected to be one of the <unk> i replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because i 'm as far as you can get from being an athlete <unk> actually i wasn 't even sure that i could go around the stadium without a walker  i was told that this was no laughing matter  this would be the first time that only women would carry the olympic flag five women representing five continents <unk> and three olympic gold medal winners  my first question was naturally what was i going to wear a uniform <unk> she said  and asked for my measurements my measurements <unk> i had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak looking like the michelin man  by the middle of february i found myself in turin where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the eighty olympic teams was in the street  <unk> athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games <unk> they all deserved to win but there 's the element of luck  a speck of snow an inch of ice <unk> the force of the wind can determine the result of a race or a game <unk>  however what matters most more than training or luck is the heart  only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal it is all about passion <unk> the streets of turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the olympics passion lives here  isn 't it always true heart is what drives us and determines our <unk> that is what i need for my characters in my books a passionate heart  i need mavericks <unk> dissidents <unk> adventurers outsiders and rebels who ask questions bend the rules and take risks people like all of you in this room  nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters  they only make <unk> in the green room of the stadium <unk> i met the other flag bearers three athletes <unk> and the actresses susan sarandon and sophia loren  also two women with passionate hearts <unk> wangari maathai the nobel prizewinner from kenya who has planted thirty million trees and by doing so she <unk> in some places in africa and of course the economic conditions in many villages <unk>  and somaly mam a cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution  when she was fourteen years old her grandfather sold her to a brothel  she told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from aids <unk>  and of brothels where children are forced to receive five fifteen clients per day and if they rebel <unk> they are tortured with electricity  in the green room i received my uniform <unk>  it was not the kind of outfit that i normally wear <unk> but it was far from the michelin man suit that i had anticipated not bad really <unk> i looked like a refrigerator  but so did most of the flag bearers except sophia loren <unk> the universal symbol of beauty and passion  sophia is over seventy and she looks great <unk>  she 's sexy <unk> slim and tall with a deep tan now how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles i don 't know  when asked in a tv interview how could she look so good <unk> my back is always straight <unk> and i don 't make old people 's noises so there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth  no grunting no coughing no wheezing no talking to yourselves <unk> no farting well she didn 't say that exactly <unk> at some point around midnight we were summoned to the wings of the stadium <unk> and the loudspeakers announced the olympic flag and the music started by the way the same music that starts here the aida march  sophia loren was right in front of me she 's a foot taller than i am not counting the poofy hair she walked elegantly like a <unk> so that my head was actually under the damn flag  all the cameras were of course on sophia that was fortunate for me because in most press photos i appear too  although often between sophia 's legs <unk> place where most men would love to be  the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the olympic stadium  my husband is offended when i say this although i have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes of those four magnificent minutes because i don 't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells <unk> i want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the olympics passion <unk> so here 's a tale of passion <unk>  the year is one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight the place is a prison camp for tutsi refugees in congo by the way <unk> eighty percent <unk> of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls  we can call this place in congo a death camp because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation <unk>  the protagonists of this story are a young woman rose mapendo and her children <unk>  she 's pregnant and a widow <unk> soldiers have forced her to watch as <unk> her husband was tortured and killed  somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive and a few months later she gives birth to premature twins two tiny little boys <unk>  she cuts the umbilical cord with a stick and ties it with her own hair <unk>  she names the twins after the camp 's commanders to gain their favor and feeds them with black tea <unk> because her milk cannot sustain them  when the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go even when they hold a gun to her head <unk>  somehow <unk> the family survives for sixteen months <unk> and then  by extraordinary luck <unk> and the passionate heart of a young american man <unk> sasha chanoff who manages to put her in a u s rescue plane <unk> rose mapendo and her nine children end up in phoenix <unk> arizona where they 're now living and thriving  mapendo in swahili means great love <unk>  the protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like rose mapendo <unk> i don 't make them up  there 's no need for that i look around and i see them everywhere i have worked with women and for women all my life i know them well <unk>  i was born in ancient times at the end of the world in a patriarchal catholic and conservative family  no wonder that by age five i was a raging feminist although the term had not reached chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me  i would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom <unk> and for questioning the patriarchy <unk> but i was happy to pay it because for every blow that i received i was able to deliver two  once when my daughter paula was in her twenties <unk> she said to me that feminism was dated that i should move we had a memorable fight <unk> feminism is dated <unk>  yes for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today <unk> but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage prostitution forced labor they have children that they don 't want or they cannot feed they have no control over their <unk> bodies or their lives they have no education and no freedom <unk> they are raped beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity  for most western young women of today being called a feminist is an insult  feminism has never been sexy <unk> but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting and i have seldom suffered from lack of men <unk> feminism is not dead by no means it has evolved  if you don 't like the term change it for goddess ' sake call it aphrodite or venus or bimbo or whatever you want <unk>  the name doesn 't matter as long as we understand what it is about and we support it  so here 's another tale of passion <unk> and this is a sad one <unk>  the place is a small women 's clinic in a village in bangladesh <unk> the year is two thousand and five jenny is a young american dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her three week vacation she 's prepared to clean teeth <unk>  but when she gets there she finds out that there are no doctors no dentists <unk> and the clinic is just a hut full of flies <unk> a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated the first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars <unk>  jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth <unk>  she 's not licensed for that she has never done it she risks a lot and she 's terrified  she doesn 't even have the proper instruments <unk> but fortunately she has brought some novocaine <unk> jenny has a brave and passionate heart <unk> she murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation  at the end the relieved patient kisses her hands that day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth <unk>  the next morning when she comes again to the so called clinic her first patient is waiting for her with her husband the woman 's face looks <unk> like a watermelon it is so swollen that you can 't even see the eyes <unk> the husband furious threatens to kill the american  jenny is horrified at what she has done  but then the translator explains that the patient 's condition has nothing to do with the operation <unk>  <unk> her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him  millions of women live like this today <unk> they are the poorest of the poor <unk>  although women do two thirds of the world 's labor they own less than one percent of the world 's assets <unk>  they are paid less than men for the same work if they 're paid at all  and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are <unk> constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse  it is a fact that giving women education work <unk> the ability to control their own income <unk> inherit and own property <unk> benefits the society  if a woman is empowered her children and her family will be better off  if families prosper the village prospers and eventually so does the whole country <unk>  wangari maathai <unk> goes to a village in kenya she talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees  she gets the women to plant new trees and water them drop by drop  in a matter of five or six years they have a forest the soil is enriched and the village is saved  the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy  for every dollar given to a women 's program <unk> twenty dollars are given to men 's programs  women are fifty one percent of humankind empowering them will change everything more than technology and <unk> i can promise you that women working together linked <unk> informed and educated can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet <unk>  in any war today most of the casualties are civilians mainly women and children <unk> they are collateral damage  men run the world and look at the mess we have what kind of world do we want this is a fundamental question that most <unk> of us are asking does it make sense to participate in the existing world order  we want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody not only for the privileged  in january i saw an exhibit of fernando botero 's paintings <unk> berkeley library  no museum or gallery in the united states <unk> except for the new york gallery that carries botero 's work has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the abu ghraib prison <unk>  they are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power in the voluminous botero style i have not been able to get those images out of my mind <unk> or my heart what i fear most is power with impunity <unk> i fear abuse of power and the power to abuse <unk>  in our species <unk> the alpha males define reality and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules  the rules change all the time but they always benefit them  and in this case the trickle down effect which does not work in economics <unk> works perfectly abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom <unk> women and children especially the poor are at the bottom even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse a woman or a child  i 'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender
