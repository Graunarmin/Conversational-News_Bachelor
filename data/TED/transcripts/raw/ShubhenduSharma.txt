 <unk> it can spread over acres and acres of area or it could fit in a small space as small as your house garden <unk> is just two years old  i have a forest in the backyard of my own house <unk>  it attracts a lot of biodiversity bird call i wake up to this every morning like a disney princess  i am an entrepreneur who facilitates the making of <unk> public parks and even a zoo to have one of such forests a forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together a forest can be an integral part of <unk> our urban existence  a forest for me is a place so dense with trees that you just can 't walk into it it doesn 't matter how big or small they are  most of the world we live in today was forest this was before human intervention then we built up our cities on those forests like so paulo <unk> we belong to nature as well <unk> as much as eight point four million other species on the planet  our habitat stopped being our natural habitat  but not anymore for some of us a few others and i today make these forests professionally anywhere and everywhere <unk>  i 'm an industrial engineer <unk> i specialize in making cars in my previous job at toyota i learned how <unk> natural resources into products  to give you an example we would drip the sap out of a rubber tree convert it into raw rubber and make a tire out of it the product  but these products can never become a natural resource again  we separate the elements from nature and convert them into an irreversible state that 's industrial production  nature on the <unk> other hand works in a totally opposite way the natural system produces by bringing elements together <unk> atom by atom  all the natural products become a natural resource again  this is something which i learned when i made a forest in the backyard of <unk> my own house and this was the first time i worked with nature rather than against it since then we have made such forests in twenty five cities across the world  every time we work at a new place <unk> we find that every single element needed to make a forest is available right around us <unk> all we have to do is to bring these elements together and let nature take over <unk> to make a forest we start with soil <unk> we touch <unk> feel and even taste it to identify what properties it lacks if the soil is made up of small particles it becomes compact so compact that water cannot seep in we mix some local biomass available around which can help soil become more porous  water can now <unk> now seep in if the soil doesn 't have the capacity to hold water <unk> we will mix some more biomass some water absorbent material like peat or bagasse so soil can hold this water and it stays moist to grow plants need water sunlight and nutrition  what if the soil doesn 't have any nutrition in it we don 't just <unk> add nutrition directly to the soil <unk> that would be the industrial way <unk> it goes against nature <unk>  we instead add microorganisms to the soil they produce the nutrients in the soil naturally  they feed on the biomass we have mixed in the soil <unk> so all they have to do is eat and multiply <unk> and as their number grows the soil starts breathing again it becomes alive <unk>  we survey the native tree species of the place how do we decide what 's native or not  well <unk> whatever existed before human intervention is native that 's the simple rule <unk>  we survey a national park to find the last remains of a natural forest  we survey the sacred groves or sacred forests around old temples <unk> and if we don 't find anything at all we go to museums to see the seeds or wood of trees existing there a long time ago we research old paintings <unk> poems and literature from the place to identify the tree species belonging there  once we know our trees we divide them in four different layers <unk> shrub layer sub tree layer tree layer and canopy layer <unk> we fix the ratios of each layer and then we decide the percentage of each tree species in the mix  if we are making a fruit forest we increase the percentage of fruit bearing trees it could be a flowering forest  a forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees or it could simply be a native <unk> wild evergreen forest <unk> we collect the seeds and germinate saplings out of them  we make sure that trees belonging to the same layer are not planted next to each other or they will fight for the same vertical space when they grow tall  we plant the saplings close to each other  on the surface we spread a thick layer of mulch <unk> so when it 's hot outside the soil stays moist when it 's cold <unk> frost formation happens <unk> only on the mulch <unk> so soil can still breathe while it 's freezing outside the soil is very soft so soft that roots can penetrate into it easily rapidly <unk>  initially the forest doesn 't seem like it 's growing but it 's growing under the surface in the first three months roots reach a depth of one meter  these roots form a mesh <unk> holding the soil <unk>  microbes and fungi live throughout this network of roots  so if some nutrition is not available in the vicinity of a tree <unk> these microbes are going to get the nutrition to the tree <unk>  whenever it it rains <unk> magically <unk> mushrooms appear overnight and this means the soil below has a healthy <unk> once these roots are established forest starts growing on the surface as the forest grows we keep watering it for the next two to three years <unk> we water the forest <unk>  we want to keep all the water and soil nutrition only for our trees so we remove the weeds growing on the ground as this forest <unk> it blocks the sunlight  eventually the forest becomes so dense that sunlight can 't reach the ground anymore <unk> weeds cannot grow now because they need sunlight as well <unk>  at this stage <unk> every single drop of water that falls into the forest doesn 't evaporate back into the atmosphere  this dense forest condenses the moist air and retains its moisture  we gradually reduce and eventually stop watering the forest <unk> without watering the forest floor stays moist and sometimes even dark  now <unk> when a single leaf falls on this forest floor <unk> it immediately starts decaying  this decayed biomass forms humus which is food for the forest <unk>  as the forest grows more leaves fall on the surface it means more humus is produced it means more food so the forest can grow <unk> still bigger and this forest keeps growing exponentially <unk>  once established these forests are going to regenerate themselves again and again probably forever  in a natural forest like this no management is the best management it 's a tiny <unk> this forest grows as a collective <unk> if the same trees same species would have been planted independently it wouldn 't grow so fast  and this is how we create a 100 year old forest in just ten years <unk> thank you very much
