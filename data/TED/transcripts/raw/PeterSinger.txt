 <unk> it 's a story that 's deeply unsettled millions in china <unk>  footage of a two year old girl hit by a van and left bleeding in the street by passersby <unk> footage too graphic to be shown the entire accident is caught on camera <unk>  the driver pauses after hitting the child <unk> his back wheels seen resting on her for over a second  within two minutes three people pass two year old wang yue by  the first walks around the badly injured toddler completely <unk> others look at her before moving <unk> there were other people who walked past wang yue and a second van ran over her legs before a street cleaner raised the alarm  she was rushed to hospital but it was too late <unk> she died  i wonder how many of you looking at that said to yourselves just now i would not have done that  i would have stopped to help raise your hands if that thought occurred to you as i thought that 's most of you <unk>  and i believe you i 'm sure you 're right <unk> but before you give yourself too much credit look at this <unk>  unicef reports that in two thousand and eleven <unk>  six point nine million children under five died from preventable <unk> thinks that that 's good news because the figure has been steadily coming down from twelve million in one thousand nine hundred and ninety <unk> that is good  but still <unk> six point nine million is nineteen thousand children dying every day <unk> does it really matter that we 're not walking past them in the street does it really matter that <unk> that they 're far away <unk>  i don 't think it does make a morally relevant difference <unk>  the fact that they 're not right in front of us the fact of course that they 're of a different nationality or race <unk> none of that seems morally relevant to me  what is really important is can we reduce that death toll can we save some of those nineteen thousand children dying every day and the answer is yes we can each of us spends money on things that we do not really need <unk> you can think what your own habit is whether it 's a new car a vacation or just something like buying bottled water when the water that comes out of the tap is perfectly safe to drink <unk> you could take the money you 're spending on those unnecessary things and give it to this organization the against malaria foundation  which would take the money you had given and use it to buy nets like this one to protect children like this one <unk> and we know reliably that if we provide nets they 're used <unk> and they reduce the number of children dying from malaria just one of the many preventable diseases that are responsible for some of those nineteen thousand children dying every day <unk>  fortunately more and more people are understanding this idea <unk>  and the result is a growing movement effective altruism  it 's important because it combines both the heart and the head <unk> the heart of course you felt <unk> you felt the empathy for that child <unk> but it 's really important to use the head as well to make sure that what you do is effective and well directed and not only that but also i think reason helps us to understand that other <unk> wherever they are are like us that they can suffer as we can that parents grieve for the deaths of their children as we do <unk>  and that just as our lives and our well being matter to us <unk> it matters just as much to all of these people <unk>  so i think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want it does help us to put perspective on our <unk> and i think that 's why many of the most significant people in effective altruism have been people who have had backgrounds in philosophy or economics or math <unk> and that might seem surprising because a lot of people think philosophy is remote from the real world  economics we 're told just makes us more <unk> and we know that math is for nerds  but in fact it does make a difference and in fact there 's one particular nerd who has been a particularly effective altruist because he got this  this is the website of the bill & melinda gates foundation and if you look at the words on the top right hand side it says all lives have equal <unk> that 's the understanding the rational understanding of our situation in the world that has led to these people being the most effective altruists in history <unk>  bill and melinda gates and warren buffett  no one not andrew carnegie <unk> not john d rockefeller has ever given as much to charity as each one of these three <unk>  and they have used their intelligence to make sure that it is highly effective  according to one estimate the gates foundation has already saved five point eight million lives and many millions more people getting diseases that would <unk> made them very sick even if eventually they survived  over the coming years <unk> undoubtably the gates foundation is going to give a lot more is going to save a lot more lives well you might say that 's fine if you 're a billionaire <unk> you can have that kind of impact <unk>  but if i 'm not what can i do <unk> so i 'm going to look at four questions that people ask that maybe stand in the way of them giving <unk> they worry how much of a difference they can make <unk> but you don 't have to be a billionaire <unk>  this is toby ord he 's a research fellow in philosophy at the university of oxford  he became an effective altruist when he calculated that with the money that he was likely to earn throughout his career an academic career <unk> he could give enough to cure eighty thousand people <unk> people of blindness in developing countries and still have enough left for a perfectly adequate standard of living <unk> so toby founded an organization called giving what we can to spread this information to unite people who want to share some of their <unk> and to ask people to pledge to give ten percent of what they earn over their lifetime to fighting global poverty <unk>  toby himself does better than that he 's pledged to live on eighteen thousand pounds a year that 's less than thirty thousand dollars and to give the rest to those organizations <unk> and yes <unk> toby is married and he does have a mortgage <unk> this is a couple at a later stage of life <unk>  charlie bresler and diana schott who when they were young when they met were activists against the vietnam war <unk>  fought for social justice <unk>  and then moved into careers as most people do didn 't really do anything very active about those values although they didn 't abandon them <unk>  and then as they got to the age at which many people start to think of retirement  they returned to <unk> them <unk> and they 've decided to cut back on their spending to live modestly <unk> and to give both money and time to helping to fight global poverty  now <unk> mentioning time might lead you to think well <unk> should i abandon my career and put all of my time into saving some of these nineteen thousand lives that are lost every day one person who 's thought quite a bit about this issue of how you can have a career that will have the biggest impact for good in the world is will crouch  he 's a graduate student in philosophy  and he 's set up a website called eighty thousand hours the number of hours he estimates most people spend on their career to advise people on how to have the best most effective career <unk> but you might be surprised to know that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider if they have the right abilities and character is to go into banking or finance  why because if you earn a lot of money you can give away a lot of money and if you 're successful in that career <unk> you could give enough to an aid organization so that it could employ <unk> let 's say five aid workers in developing countries and each one of them would probably do about as much good as you would have done <unk> so you can quintuple the impact by leading that kind of career <unk>  here 's one young man who 's taken this advice <unk> his name is matt <unk> he was a student at princeton in philosophy and math <unk> actually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis last year when he graduated <unk>  but he 's gone into finance in new york he 's already earning enough so that he 's giving a six figure sum to effective charities and still leaving himself with enough to live on  matt has also helped me to set up an organization that i 'm working with that has the name taken <unk> from the title of a book i wrote the life you can save which is trying to change our culture so that more people think that if we 're going to live an ethical life it 's not enough just to follow the and not cheat steal maim kill <unk> but that if we have enough we have to share some of that with people who have so little and the <unk> organization draws together people of different generations like holly morgan who 's an undergraduate who 's pledged to give ten percent of the little amount that she has  and on the right ada wan <unk> who has worked directly for the poor <unk> but has now gone to yale to do an mba to have more to give  many people will think though <unk>  <unk> really all that effective so let 's talk about effectiveness <unk> toby ord is very concerned about this and he 's calculated that some charities are hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than others <unk> so it 's very important to find the effective ones  take for example <unk> providing a guide dog for a blind person  that 's a good thing to do right <unk> a good thing to do <unk> but you have to think what else you could do with the resources <unk>  it costs about forty thousand dollars to train a guide dog and train the recipient so that the guide dog can be an effective help to a blind person <unk>  it costs somewhere between twenty and fifty dollars to cure a blind person in a developing country if they have trachoma <unk>  <unk> so you do the sums <unk> and you get something like that you could provide one guide dog for one blind american  or you could cure between four hundred and two thousand people of blindness  i think it 's clear what 's the better thing to do <unk>  but if you want to look for effective charities  this is a good website to go to givewell exists to really assess the impact of charities not just whether they and it 's screened hundreds of charities and currently is recommending only three of which the against malaria foundation is number one <unk>  so it 's very tough if you want to look for other recommendations and giving what we can both have a somewhat broader list <unk> but you can find effective <unk> and not just in the area of saving lives from the poor <unk> i 'm pleased to say that there is now also a website looking at effective animal organizations <unk> that 's another cause that i 've been concerned about all my life <unk>  <unk> the immense amount of suffering that humans inflict on literally tens of billions of animals every year <unk> so if you want to look for effective organizations to reduce that suffering you can go to effective animal activism  <unk> effective altruists think it 's very important to make sure that our species survives at all so they 're looking at ways to reduce the risk of extinction <unk>  here 's one risk of extinction that we all became aware of recently when an asteroid passed close to our planet <unk>  possibly research could help us not only to predict the path of <unk> asteroids that might collide with us <unk> but actually to deflect them <unk> so some people think that would be a good thing to give to there 's many possibilities  my final question is some people will think it 's a burden to give <unk>  i don 't really believe it is i 've enjoyed giving all of my life since i was a graduate student it 's been something fulfilling to me <unk>  charlie bresler said to me that he 's not an altruist he thinks that the life he 's saving is his own <unk>  and holly morgan told me that she used to battle depression until she got involved with effective altruism <unk> and now is one of the happiest people she knows  i think one of the reasons for this is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome what i call the sisyphus problem <unk>  here 's sisyphus as portrayed by titian <unk> condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder up to the top of the hill just as he gets there <unk> the effort <unk> becomes too much the boulder escapes rolls all the way down the hill he has to trudge back down to push it up again and the same thing happens again and again for all eternity  does that remind you of a consumer lifestyle <unk>  where you you work hard to get money you spend that money on consumer goods which you hope you 'll enjoy using <unk>  but then <unk> the money 's gone you have to work hard to get more spend more and to maintain the same level of happiness it 's kind of a hedonic treadmill you never get off <unk> and you never really feel satisfied <unk>  becoming an effective altruist gives you that meaning and fulfillment <unk>  it enables you to have a solid basis for self esteem on which you can feel your life was really worth living <unk>  i 'm going to conclude by telling you about an email that i received while i was writing this this talk just a month or so ago it 's from a man named chris croy <unk> who i 'd never heard of this is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery <unk> why was he recovering from surgery <unk> the email began <unk> i anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger <unk> that started a kidney chain which enabled four people to receive kidneys  there 's about one hundred people each year in the u s and more in other countries who do that  i was pleased to read it chris went on to say that he 'd been influenced by my writings in what he did  well i have to admit i 'm also somewhat embarrassed by that because i still have two kidneys but chris went on to say that he didn 't think that what he 'd done was all that amazing <unk>  because he calculated that the number of life years that he had added to people the extension of life  was about the same that you could achieve if you gave five thousand dollars to the against malaria foundation  and that did make me feel a little <unk> bit better because i have given more than five thousand dollars to the against malaria foundation and to various other effective charities <unk>  so if you 're feeling bad because you still have two kidneys as well <unk> there 's a way for you to get off the hook
