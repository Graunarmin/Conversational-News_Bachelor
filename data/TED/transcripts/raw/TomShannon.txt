 <unk> start with a question that has just been consuming me since i first became familiar with your work in you work there 's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force in some sort of interplay with creative force are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work tom shannon yeah <unk> the subject matter that i 'm looking for it 's usually to solve a question i had the question popped into my head what does the cone that connects the sun and and the earth look like if you could connect the two spheres  and in proportion what would <unk> the size of the sphere and the length and what would the taper be to the earth  and so i went about and made that sculpture <unk> turning it out of solid bronze and i did one that was about thirty five feet long the sun end was about four inches in diameter and then it tapered over about thirty five feet to about a millimeter at the earth end and so for me it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context <unk> as though you were an astronaut and see these two things as an object <unk> because they are so intimately bound and one is meaningless without the other jh is there a relief in playing with these forces <unk> and i 'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces <unk> that that silver one there that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets trying to find a way to make something float with the least possible connection to the ground so i got it down to just one tether to be able to support that jh now is this electromagnetic here or are these static ts those are <unk> the magnetic works are a combination of gravity and and magnetism so it 's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything <unk> the sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the <unk> and the earth 's magnetic field protects us from the sun so there 's this huge invisible shape structures that that magnetism takes in the universe <unk> but with the pendulum <unk> it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets magnets up my sculptures are <unk> normally very simplified i try to refine them down to very simple forms but the paintings become very complex because i think the fields that are supporting them they 're billowing and they 're interpenetrating and <unk> they 're interference patterns jh and they 're <unk> <unk> i mean you don 't know necessarily where you 're headed when you begin <unk> even though the forces can be calculated <unk> first one i did was in the late seventy 's and i just had a simple cone with a spigot at the bottom of it  i threw it into an orbit and it only had one color and when it got to the center the paint kept running out so i had to run in there didn 't have any control over the spigot remotely <unk>  so that told me right away i need a remote control device <unk> i started dreaming of having six colors <unk> i sort of think about it as the dna these colors <unk> the red blue yellow <unk> the primary colors and white and black and <unk> if you put them together in different combinations just like printing in a sense like how a magazine color is printed and put them under certain forces <unk>  <unk> these amazing things started appearing jh it looks like we 're loaded for bear here ts yeah <unk> well let 's put a couple of canvases i 'll ask a couple of my sons to set up the canvases <unk> going to throw this into an orbit and see if i can paint everybody 's shoes in the front <unk> as a demo <unk> and it 's more playful <unk> but inevitably all of this can be used <unk> i can redeem this painting just continuing on  doing layers upon layers and i keep it around for a couple of weeks <unk> do another session with it and bring it up to another level where all of this becomes the background <unk> the depth of it jh that 's fantastic  so the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are and they can pinch them very tight and stop it or you can have them wide open  and all all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom you can always be changing colors put aluminum paint or i could put anything into this it could be tomato sauce <unk> so many forces there you 've got gravity you 've got the centrifugal force you 've got the fluid dynamics <unk> each of these beautiful paintings are they images in and of themselves or are they records of a physical event <unk> i wanted to do something very simple a simple iconic image of two two ripples interfering <unk> so the one on the right was done first <unk>  and then the one on the left was done over over it and then i left gaps so you could see the one that was done before <unk> and then when i did the second one  it really disturbed the piece these big blue lines crashing through so it created a kind of tension and an overlap <unk> there are lines in front of the one on the right and there are lines behind the one on the left and so it takes it into different planes what it 's also about just the little events  <unk> two things that happened there 's an interference pattern and then a third thing happens there are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two two events that are happening very interested in that like the occurrence of moire patterns like this green one this is a painting i did about ten years ago <unk> but it has some see in the upper third <unk> there there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery and that 's something that in painting i 've never seen done i 've never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns <unk> which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives <unk> is that a literal part of the image or is my eye making that interference pattern is my eye completing that interference pattern ts it is the paint actually <unk> makes it real <unk>  it 's really manifested there if i throw a very concentric circle or concentric ellipse <unk> it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines <unk> which get closer and closer together <unk>  which describes how gravity works there 's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that that i really enjoy and i love the shapes that i see in in scientific observations and apparatus especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it the scale is very interesting to me <unk> in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology <unk> some of these paintings when you look at them very close <unk>  odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or crocodiles <unk> elephants there are lots of things that appear when you look into it it 's sort of like looking at cloud patterns but sometimes they 're very modeled and <unk> and then there are all these forms that we don 't know what they are but they 're equally <unk> well resolved and complex <unk>  so i think conceivably those could be predictive <unk> because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we 're familiar with in biology it 's also making other forms that we 're not familiar with and maybe it 's the kind of forms we 'll discover underneath <unk> at this stage in your life <unk> you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant i suppose it 's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your parkinson 's and this creative force that both the the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life <unk> is that <unk> as it turns out this device kind of comes in handy because i don 't have to have the the fine motor skills to do that i can operate slides which is <unk> more of a mental process <unk> i 'm looking at it and making decisions it needs more red it needs more blue it needs a different shape and so i make these creative decisions and can execute them in a much much simpler way <unk> i mean i 've got the symptoms i guess parkinson 's kind of creeps up over the years but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms <unk> my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also <unk> i 'm left handed and so i i draw all my creations really start on small drawings <unk> which i have thousands of and it 's my way of just thinking i draw with a simple pencil and at <unk> parkinson 's was really upsetting because i couldn 't get the pencil to stand still jh so you 're not a gatekeeper for these forces you don 't think of yourself as the master of these forces you think of yourself as the servant ts nature is well it 's a godsend <unk> it just has so much in it and i think nature wants wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature humans are of the universe <unk> the universe is in our mind and our minds are in the universe and we are expressions of the universe <unk> basically as humans ultimately being part of the universe we 're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency <unk> to interface with it with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do <unk> giving them pigment and paint just like an artist  it 's a good ally <unk> it 's a terrific studio assistant jh well i love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand <unk> some sort of more elemental force gets revealed <unk> and that 's the beauty here
