 <unk> the school of architecture that i studied at some thirty years ago happened to be across the street from the wonderful art gallery designed by the great architect louis kahn i love the building and i used to visit it quite often one day i saw the security guard run his hand across the concrete wall <unk> and it was the way he did it the expression on his face something touched me i could see that the security guard was moved by the building and that architecture has that capacity to move you <unk> i could see it and i remember thinking wow  how does architecture do that at school i was learning to design but here here was a reaction of the heart <unk> and it touched me to the core <unk> aspire for beauty for <unk> for atmosphere <unk> the emotional response  that 's the realm of the ineffable and the immeasurable <unk> and that 's what you live for  a chance to try <unk>  so in two thousand and three there was an open call for designs for the bah ' temple for south america <unk> this was the first temple in all of south america it 's a continental temple a hugely important milestone for the bah ' community because this would be the last of the continental temples and would open the door for national and local temples to be built around the world and the brief was deceptively simple and unique in the annals of religion a circular room <unk> nine sides nine entrances nine paths <unk>  allowing you to come to the temple from all directions <unk> nine symbolizing completeness perfection <unk>  no pulpit no sermons as there are no clergy in the <unk> and in a world which is putting up walls <unk> the design needed to express in form the very opposite <unk> it had to be open welcoming to people of all faiths walks of life <unk> backgrounds or no faith no faith at <unk> a new form of sacred space with no pattern or models to draw from  it was like designing one of the first churches for christianity or one of the first mosques for islam so we live in a secular world  how do you design sacred space today <unk> and how do you even define what 's sacred today <unk>  i stumbled across this beautiful quote from the bah <unk> ' writings <unk> and it speaks to prayer <unk>  it says that if you reach out in prayer <unk> and if your prayer is answered which is already very interesting that the pillars of your heart <unk> heart will become ashine  and i loved this idea of the inner and the outer  like when you see someone and you say that person is radiant  and i was thinking my gosh how could we make something architectural out of <unk> you create a building and it becomes alive with light <unk>  like alabaster if you kiss it with light it becomes alive <unk> and i drew this sketch something with two layers <unk> translucent with structure in between capturing light <unk> maybe a pure form <unk> a single form of emanation that you could imagine would be all dome and everything we kept making was looking too much like an egg  laughter a blob  so you search you all know this crazy search letting the process take you  and you live for the surprises and i remember quite by accident i saw this little video of a plant <unk> moving in light <unk>  and it made me think of movement  reach this idea that the temple could have reach like this reach for the divine  you can imagine also that movement within a circle could mean movement and stillness like the cosmos  something you see in many places but rotation was not enough <unk> because we needed a form in the bah <unk> ' writings it talks about the temples being as perfect as is humanly possible <unk> and we kept thinking well what is perfection <unk> and i remember i stumbled into this image of this japanese basket and thinking our western notions of <unk> perfection need to be challenged that this this wonderful silhouette of this basket this wonkiness  and that it has the kind of dimple of of what you might imagine a shoulder or the cheekbone and that kind of organic form <unk>  and so we drew and made models these lines that merge at the top soft lines <unk> which became like drapery and translucent veils and folding  and the idea of not only folding but torquing you remember the plant and the way it was reaching <unk>  and this started to become an interesting form <unk> carving the base making the <unk> then we ended up with this this is this temple with two layers <unk>  nine luminous veils embodied light soft flowing lines like luminescent drapery one hundred and eighty submissions were received from eighty countries <unk> and this was selected so we went to the next stage of how to build it we had submitted <unk> alabaster <unk> but alabaster was too soft <unk> and we were experimenting many experiments with materials trying to think how we could have this kind of shimmer <unk> and we ended up with <unk> the right temperature we ended up with this new material this new cast glass which took us about two years to make <unk>  and it had this quality that we loved this idea of the embodied light <unk>  but on the inside  we wanted something with a soft light <unk> like the inner lining of a jacket on the outside you have protection but on the inside you touch it so we found this tiny vein in a huge quarry in portugal with this beautiful stone which the owner had kept for seven generations in his family <unk> waiting for the right project if you can believe it <unk> look <unk> 's beautiful and the way it lights up it has that translucent quality  so here you see the structure it lets the light through <unk> and looking down <unk> the nine wings are bound structurally but symbolically strong <unk>  a great symbol of unity pure <unk> perfect circle thirty meters in section and in plan perfectly symmetrical like the idea of sacredness and geometry <unk> and here you see the building going up two thousand steel nodes <unk> nine thousand pieces of steel  seven thousand eight hundred stone pieces ten thousand cast glass pieces all individual shapes <unk> the entire <unk> superstructure all described <unk> engineered fabricated with aerospace technology prefabricated machine to machine robotically <unk> a huge team effort you can imagine of literally hundreds <unk> and within three percent of our $ thirty million budget set in two thousand and six nine wings bound together forming a <unk> nine pointed star and the star shape moving in space tracking the sun <unk> a befitting response to that beautiful quote a prayer answered open in all directions capturing the blue light of dawn tent like white light of day <unk> the gold light of the afternoon and of course at night <unk> the reversal <unk>  sensuous catching the light in all kinds of mysterious ways <unk> and the site it 's interesting fourteen years ago when we made the submission we showed the temple set against the andes we didn 't have the andes as our site but after nine years that 's exactly where we ended up  the lines of the temple set against nothing but pure nature and you turn around and you get nothing but the city below you and inside <unk> a view in all directions <unk> radiating gardens from each of the alcoves <unk>  radiating paths <unk>  last october <unk> the opening ceremonies a beautiful sacred event <unk> thousand people from eighty countries <unk> a continuous river of visitors <unk> indigenous people from all over south america some who had never left their villages <unk>  and of course that this temple belongs to people the collective of many cultures and walks of life many beliefs and for me what 's most important is what it feels like on the inside that it feel intimate sacred and that everyone is welcome <unk> and if even a few who come have the same reaction as that security <unk> then it truly would be their temple <unk> and i would love that thank you
