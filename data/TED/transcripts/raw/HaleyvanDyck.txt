 <unk> i 'm here to talk to you today about a story that we have all been conditioned to believe is not possible <unk>  it 's a story about a living breathing start up flourishing in an unlikely environment the united states <unk> is fundamentally beginning to disrupt the way government does business from the inside out but before i get there let 's start with the problem  for me <unk> the problem begins with a number one hundred and thirty seven  one hundred and thirty seven is the average number of days a veteran has to wait to have benefits processed by the va one hundred and thirty seven days  now in order to file that application in the first place she has to navigate over one thousand different websites and over nine hundred <unk> different call in numbers all owned and operated by the united states government  now we live in times of incredible change the private sector is constantly changing and improving itself all the time  for that matter <unk> it 's removing every single inconvenience in my life that i could possibly think of  i could be sitting on my couch in my apartment <unk> and from my phone i can order a warm gluten free meal that can arrive at my door in less than ten minutes <unk>  but meanwhile a working mother who depends on food stamps to support her family has to complete an arduous complicated application which she might not even be able to do online  and the inability of her to do that same work from her couch means that she might be having to take days or hours off of work that she can 't spare  and this growing dichotomy between the beneficiaries of the tech revolution and those it 's left behind is one of the greatest challenges of our time  because government 's failure to deliver digital services that work is disproportionately impacting the very people who <unk> it 's impacting the students trying to go to college the single mothers trying to get health care the veterans coming home from battle they can 't get what they need when they need it  and for these americans government is more than just a presidential election every four years  government is a lifeline that provides services they need and depend on and deserve <unk>  which is quite frankly <unk> why government needs to get its shit together and catch up <unk> this wasn 't always a problem i was passionate about when i joined president obama 's campaign in two thousand and eight we brought the tech industry 's best practices into politics  we earned more money we engaged more volunteers and we earned more votes than any political campaign in history <unk>  we were a cutting edge start up that changed the game of politics <unk> when the president asked a small group of us to bring that very same disruption directly into government <unk> i knew it wasn 't going to be easy work but i was eager and showed up ready to get to work  now <unk> on my first day in dc my first day in government <unk>  i walked into the office and they handed me a laptop and the laptop was running windows ninety eight i mean three entire presidential elections had come and gone since the government had updated the operating system on <unk> computer <unk> three elections <unk>  which is when we realized this problem was a whole lot bigger than we ever could have imagined <unk> let me paint the picture for you <unk>  the federal government is the largest institution in the world it spends over eighty six billion dollars a year eighty six billion on <unk> for context that is more than the entire venture capital industry spends annually on everything <unk>  now <unk> the problem here is that we the taxpayers are not getting what we pay for because <unk> percent of federal it projects are over budget or behind schedule <unk> ninety four percent for those of you keeping score yes the number ninety four is very close to one <unk> there 's another problem forty percent of those never end up seeing the light of day they are completely scrapped or abandoned <unk>  now <unk> this is a very existentially painful moment for any organization <unk> because it means as government continues to operate as it 's programmed to do failure is nearly inevitable  and when the status quo is the riskiest option that means there is simply no other choice than radical disruption <unk> so what do we do about it how do we fix this  well <unk> the irony of all of this is that we actually don 't have to look any further than our backyard <unk> because right here in america are the very ideas the very people who have swept our world into a radically different place than it was two decades ago <unk>  so what would it look like if it was actually as easy to get student loans or veterans ' benefits as it is to order cat food to my house  what would it look like if there was an easy pathway for the very entrepreneurs and innovators who have disrupted our tech sector to come and disrupt their government <unk>  well my friends here 's where we get to talk about some of the exciting new formulas we 've discovered for creating change in government <unk>  enter the united states digital service the united states digital service <unk> a new network of start ups a team of teams <unk> organizing themselves across government to create radical change <unk>  the mission of the united states digital service is to help government deliver world class digital services for students immigrants <unk> children <unk> the elderly everybody at dramatically lower <unk> we are essentially trying to build a more awesome government <unk> for the people by the people today we don 't care thank you  who doesn 't want a more awesome government right <unk>  we don 't care about politics we care about making government work better <unk> because it 's the only one we 've got  now <unk> you can think <unk> pretty funny you can think of our team a little bit like the peace corps meets darpa meets seal team six we 're like the peace corps for nerds but instead of traveling to crazy interesting far off places you spend a lot of time indoors behind computers <unk> helping restore the fabric of our democracy  laughter now <unk> this team our playbook for the united states digital service is pretty simple <unk>  the first play is we recruit the very best talent our country has to offer and recruit them for short tours of duty inside government <unk> these are the very people who have helped build the products and companies that have made our tech sector amongst the most innovative in the world <unk>  second <unk> we pair these incredible people from the tech core with the dedicated civil servants already inside government on the ground creating change <unk>  third <unk> we strategically <unk> important services that government offers <unk> and finally we give them massive air cover from the leadership inside the agencies all the way up to the president himself  to transform these services for the better <unk>  now <unk> this team is beginning to disrupt how government does business from the inside out <unk> if you study classic patterns of disruption one very common pattern is rather simple <unk> it 's to take something <unk> that has become routine and standard in one industry and apply it to another where it 's a radical departure from the status quo  think about what airbnb took that was normal from hospitality and revolutionized my apartment  the united states digital service is doing exactly that we are taking what silicon valley and the private sector has learned through a ton of hard <unk> digital services that delight users at lower cost and we 're applying that to government where it is a radical departure from the status quo <unk>  now <unk> the good news is it 's starting to work we know this because we can already see the results from some of our early projects like the rescue effort of healthcare gov when that went off the rails <unk>  fixing healthcare gov was the first place that we ran this play and today we are taking that same play and scaling it across a large number <unk> of government 's most important citizen facing services <unk> now <unk> if i can take a moment and brag about the team for a second it is the highest concentration of badasses i could have ever dreamed of  we have top talent from google facebook amazon twitter and the likes all on staff today all choosing <unk> and what 's incredible is everybody is as eager and kind as they are intelligent  and i might add by the way  over half of us are women  applause the best way to understand this strategy is actually to walk through a couple of examples of how it 's working out in the wild i 'm going to give you two examples <unk> first one is about immigration  this my friends is your typical immigration application <unk> yes <unk> you guessed it it 's almost entirely paper based  in the best case the application takes about six to eight months to process it is physically shipped thousands of miles thousands of miles between no less than six processing centers <unk>  now <unk> little story  about a decade ago the government thought that if it brought this system online it could save taxpayer dollars and provide a better service was a great idea <unk> so <unk> the typical government process began  six years and one point two billion dollars later no working product was delivered one point two billion with a b now at this point the agency responsible us citizenship and immigration services  could have kept pouring money into the failing program <unk> sadly that 's what often happens that 's the status quo today <unk>  but they didn 't the dedicated civil servants inside the agency decided to stand up and call for change we deployed a small team of just six people <unk> and what many people don 't know is that 's the same size as the rescue effort of healthcare gov just six people  and that team jumped in side by side to support the agency in transitioning this project into more modern business practices more modern development practices <unk> speak what that basically means is taking big multi year projects and breaking them up into bite sized chunks <unk> so that way we can reduce the risk and actually start to see results every couple of weeks instead of waiting in a black box for years <unk>  so within less than three months of our team being on the ground we were already able to push our first products to production <unk>  <unk> this is used to file for your replacement green card  now for immigrant visa holders a replacement green card is a big deal your green card is your proof of identification it 's your work authorization it 's the proof that you can be here in this country <unk> <unk> so waiting six months while the government processes the replacement is not cool <unk>  <unk> faster <unk> it is cheaper and it 's a better user experience for the applicant and the government employees alike  another one quickly <unk> last fall we just released a brand new practice civics test <unk> so as part of becoming a us citizen you have to <unk> for anyone who has taken this test it can be quite the stressful process <unk>  so our team released a very easy simple to use tool in plain language to help people prepare to help ease their nerves to help them feel more confident in taking the next step in pursuing their american dream <unk>  because all of this work all of this work on immigration is about taking complicated processes and making them more human  the other day one of the dedicated civil servants on the <unk> ground said something incredibly profound <unk> she said that she 's never been this hopeful or optimistic about a project in her entire time in government <unk>  and she 's been doing this for thirty years  that is exactly the kind of hope and culture change we are trying to create <unk> for my second example i want to bring it back to <unk> and what we are doing to build them a va that is worthy of their service and their sacrifice <unk>  i 'm proud to say that just a few months ago we released a brand new beta of a new website <unk> a simple easy to use website that brings all of the online services a veteran needs into one place one website not thousands <unk> <unk> the site is a work in progress but it 's significant progress because it 's designed with the users who matter most <unk> the veterans themselves this <unk> might sound incredibly obvious <unk> because it should be but sadly this isn 't normal for government <unk> far too often product decisions are made by committees of stakeholders who do their best to represent the interests of the user but they 're not necessarily the users themselves <unk>  so our team at the va went out we looked at the data <unk> we talked to veterans themselves and we started simple and small with the two most important services that matter most to them  education benefits and disability benefits 'm proud to say that they are live on the site today <unk> and as the team continues to streamline more services they will be ported over here and the old sites shut down  to me <unk> this is what change looks like in two thousand and sixteen when you walk out of the oval office the first time i was ever there i noticed a quote the president had embroidered on the rug 's the classic jfk quote it says no problem of human destiny is beyond human beings  it 's true  we have the tools to solve these problems we have the tools to come together as a society as a country and to fix this together <unk>  yes <unk> it 's hard <unk> it 's particularly hard when we have to fight when we have to refuse to succumb to the belief that things won 't change <unk> but in my experience <unk> it 's often the hardest things that are the most worth doing  because if we don 't do them who will  this is on us all of us together <unk> because government is not an abstract institution or a concept  our government is us <unk> it is no longer a question of if change is possible <unk> the question is not
