 <unk> when dorothy was a little girl <unk> she was fascinated by her goldfish her father explained to her that fish swim by quickly wagging their tails to propel themselves through the water <unk>  without hesitation little dorothy responded yes daddy <unk> and fish swim backwards by wagging their heads <unk> in her mind <unk> it was a fact as true as any other fish swim backwards by wagging their heads <unk> she believed it  our lives are full of fish swimming backwards <unk>  we make assumptions and faulty leaps of logic we harbor bias <unk> we know that we are right and they are wrong  we fear the worst we strive for unattainable perfection  we tell ourselves what we can and cannot do  in our minds <unk> fish swim by in reverse frantically wagging their heads and we don 't even notice them i 'm going to tell you five facts about myself one fact is not true  one i graduated from harvard at nineteen with an honors degree in mathematics  two i currently run a construction company <unk> i starred on a television sitcom  four i lost my sight to a rare genetic eye disease <unk>  five i served as a law clerk to two us supreme court justices <unk> which fact is not true <unk>  actually they 're all true yeah they 're all true <unk> point most people really only care about the television show  laughter i know this from experience  ok so the show was nbc 's saved by the bell the new class and i played weasel wyzell who was the sort of dorky nerdy character <unk> which made it a very major acting challenge for me as a 13 year old boy  now <unk> did you struggle with number four my blindness why is that  we make assumptions about so called disabilities  as a blind man i confront others ' incorrect assumptions about my abilities every day  my point today is not about my blindness however <unk> it 's about my vision <unk> going blind taught me to live my life eyes wide open <unk>  it taught me to spot those backwards swimming fish that our minds create going blind cast them into focus  what does it feel like to see <unk> it 's immediate and passive you open your eyes and there 's the world seeing is believing sight is truth <unk> 's what i thought then from age twelve to twenty five my retinas progressively deteriorated  my sight became an increasingly bizarre carnival funhouse hall of mirrors and illusions  the salesperson i was relieved to spot in a store was really a mannequin <unk>  reaching down to wash my hands i suddenly saw it was a urinal i was touching not a sink when my fingers felt its true shape <unk> a friend described the photograph in my hand and only then i could see the image depicted objects appeared <unk> morphed and disappeared in my reality <unk> it was difficult and exhausting to see <unk>  i pieced together fragmented transitory images <unk> consciously analyzed the clues <unk> searched for some logic in my crumbling kaleidoscope  until i saw nothing at all i learned that what we see is not universal truth <unk> it is not objective reality <unk>  what we see is a unique personal virtual reality that is masterfully constructed by our brain <unk>  let me explain with a bit of amateur neuroscience your visual cortex takes up about thirty percent of your brain that 's compared to approximately <unk> eight percent for touch and two to three percent for hearing <unk>  every second your eyes can send your visual cortex as many as two billion pieces of information  the rest of your body can send your brain only an additional billion  so sight is one third of your brain by volume and can claim about two thirds of your brain 's processing resources <unk> it 's no surprise then <unk> that the illusion of sight is so compelling <unk> but make no mistake about it sight is an illusion <unk>  here 's where it gets interesting  to create the experience of sight  your brain references your conceptual understanding of the world other knowledge your memories opinions emotions mental attention all of these things and far more are linked in your brain to your sight these linkages work both ways and <unk> occur subconsciously <unk> so for example <unk> what you see impacts how you feel and the way you feel can literally change what you see <unk>  numerous studies demonstrate this  if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example <unk>  your answer will be different if you 're told to think about cheetahs or turtles  a hill appears steeper if you 've just exercised and a landmark appears farther away if you 're wearing a heavy backpack  we have arrived at a fundamental contradiction  what you see is a complex mental construction of your own making  but you experience it passively as a direct representation of the world around you  you create your own reality <unk> and you believe it  i believed mine until <unk> it broke apart the deterioration of my eyes shattered the illusion you see sight is just one way we shape our reality <unk> we create our own realities in many other ways <unk>  let 's take fear as just one example <unk>  your fears distort <unk> under the warped logic of fear anything is better than the uncertain  fear fills the void at all costs <unk> passing off what you dread for what you know offering up the worst in place of the ambiguous <unk>  substituting assumption for reason <unk>  psychologists have a great term for it <unk> need to look outside yourself and think critically  fear beats a retreat deep inside your mind <unk> shrinking and distorting your view <unk> drowning your capacity for critical thought with a flood of disruptive emotions <unk>  when you face a compelling opportunity to take action fear lulls you into inaction enticing you to passively watch its prophecies fulfill themselves <unk> i was diagnosed with my blinding disease <unk> i knew blindness would ruin my life blindness was a death sentence for my independence <unk> it was the end of achievement for me  blindness meant i would live an unremarkable life <unk> small and sad and likely alone <unk>  <unk> this was a fiction born of my fears <unk> but i believed it it was a lie <unk> but it was my reality <unk> just like those backwards swimming fish in little dorothy 's mind <unk>  if i had not confronted the reality of my fear i would have lived it <unk> i am certain of that  so how do you live your life eyes wide open <unk> it is a learned discipline <unk> it can be taught <unk> it can be practiced i will summarize very briefly hold yourself accountable for every moment <unk> every thought every detail  see beyond your fears <unk> recognize your assumptions harness your internal strength <unk> silence your internal critic <unk>  correct your misconceptions about luck and about <unk> accept your strengths and your weaknesses <unk> and understand the difference open your hearts to your bountiful blessings <unk>  your fears <unk> your critics your heroes your villains they are your excuses <unk> rationalizations <unk> shortcuts <unk> justifications <unk> your surrender  they are fictions you perceive as reality <unk>  choose to see through them <unk> choose to let them go <unk> you are the creator of your reality <unk>  with that empowerment comes complete responsibility <unk>  i chose to step out of fear 's tunnel into terrain uncharted and undefined <unk>  i chose to build there a blessed life  far from alone <unk> i share my beautiful life with dorothy my beautiful wife with our <unk> triplets whom we call the tripskys  and with the latest addition to the family <unk> sweet baby clementine what do you fear <unk>  what lies do you tell yourself  how do you embellish your truth and write your own fictions what reality are you creating for yourself  in your career and personal life in your relationships <unk> and in your heart and <unk> soul your backwards swimming fish do you great harm  they exact a toll in missed opportunities and unrealized potential <unk> and they engender insecurity and distrust where you seek fulfillment and connection <unk> i urge you to search them out  helen keller said that the only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no <unk> vision <unk>  for me going blind was a profound blessing <unk> because blindness gave me vision <unk>  i hope you can see what i see <unk> thank you <unk> audience of entrepreneurs of doers of innovators you are a ceo of a company down in florida and many are probably wondering how is it to be a blind ceo what kind of specific challenges do you have and how do <unk> in my leadership team meetings <unk> i don 't see facial expressions or gestures <unk>  i 've learned to solicit a lot more verbal feedback i basically force people to tell me what they think and in this respect <unk> it 's become like i said a real blessing for me personally and for my company <unk>  because we communicate at a far deeper level <unk> we avoid ambiguities <unk>  and most important my team knows that what they think truly matters
