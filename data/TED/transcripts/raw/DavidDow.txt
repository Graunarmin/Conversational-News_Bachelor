 <unk> two weeks ago <unk> i was sitting at the kitchen table with my wife katya and we were talking about what i was going to talk about today  <unk> his name is lincoln he was sitting at the same table doing his math homework <unk> and during a pause in my conversation with katya i looked over at lincoln and i was suddenly thunderstruck by a recollection of a client of mine my client was a guy named will he was from north <unk> he never knew his father very well because his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him <unk>  and so he was destined to be raised by a single mom which might have been all right except that this particular single mom was a paranoid schizophrenic <unk> and when will was five years old she tried to kill him with a butcher knife  she was taken away by authorities and placed in a psychiatric <unk> hospital <unk> and so for the next several years will lived with his older brother <unk> until he committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart <unk>  and after that will bounced around from one family member to another <unk>  until by the time he was nine years old he was essentially living on his own <unk>  that morning that i was sitting with katya and lincoln <unk> i looked at my son <unk> and i realized that when my client will was his age <unk> he 'd been living by himself for two years  will eventually joined a gang and committed a number of very serious crimes <unk>  including most seriously of all  a horrible tragic <unk> will was ultimately executed as punishment for that crime <unk>  but i don 't want to talk today about the morality of capital punishment i certainly think that my client shouldn 't have been executed but what i would like to do today instead is talk about the death penalty in a way i 've never done before in a way that is entirely noncontroversial <unk>  i think that 's possible because there is a corner of the death penalty debate maybe the most important corner where everybody agrees where the most ardent death penalty supporters and the most vociferous <unk> are on exactly the same page that 's the corner i want to explore  before i do that though i want to spend a couple of minutes telling you how a death penalty case unfolds <unk>  and then i want to tell you two lessons that i have learned over the last twenty years as a death penalty lawyer from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way you can think of a death penalty case as a <unk> story that has four chapters <unk>  the first chapter of every case is exactly the same <unk> and it is tragic <unk> it begins with the murder of an innocent human being <unk>  and it 's followed by a trial where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row and that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate <unk> the second chapter consists of a complicated legal proceeding known as a state habeas corpus appeal  the third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a federal habeas corpus proceeding and the fourth chapter is one where a variety of things can happen the lawyers might file a clemency petition <unk>  they might initiate even more complex litigation or they might not do anything at all <unk> but that fourth chapter always ends with an execution <unk> when i started representing death row inmates more than twenty years ago <unk>  people on death row did not have a right to a lawyer in either the second or the fourth chapter of this story <unk>  they were on their own <unk>  in fact it wasn 't until the late 1980s that they acquired a right to a lawyer during the third chapter of the story <unk>  so what all of these death row inmates had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers <unk> to handle their legal proceedings <unk>  the problem is that there were way more guys on death row than there were lawyers who had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases <unk>  and so inevitably lawyers drifted to cases that were already in chapter four that makes sense of course those are the cases that are most urgent those are the guys who are closest to being executed <unk> some of these lawyers were successful they managed to get new trials <unk> trials for their clients <unk> others of them managed to extend the lives of their clients sometimes by years sometimes by months <unk> but the one thing that didn 't happen was that there was never a serious and sustained decline in the number of annual executions in texas <unk>  in fact as you can see from this graph from the time that the texas execution apparatus got efficient in the mid to late 1990s there have only been a couple <unk> of years where the number of annual executions dipped below twenty  in a typical year in texas we 're averaging about two people a month <unk>  in some years in texas we 've executed close to forty people and this number has never significantly declined over the last fifteen years  and yet at the same time that we continue to execute about the same number of people <unk> every year the number of people who we 're sentencing to death on an annual basis has dropped rather steeply  so we have this paradox <unk> which is that the number of annual executions has remained high but the number of new death sentences has gone down <unk> why is that  it can 't be attributed to a decline in the murder rate because the murder rate has not declined nearly so steeply as the red line on that graph has gone down <unk> what has happened instead is that juries have started to sentence more and more people to prison for the rest of their lives without the possibility of parole rather than sending them to the execution chamber <unk>  why has that happened it hasn 't happened because of a dissolution of popular support for the death penalty death penalty opponents <unk> take great solace in the fact that death penalty support in texas is at an all time low  do you know what all time low in texas means it means that it 's in the low sixty percent <unk>  now that 's really good compared to the mid 1980s when it was in excess of eighty percent <unk> but we can 't explain the decline in death sentences and the affinity <unk> for life without the possibility of parole by an erosion of support for the death penalty because people still support the death penalty <unk> what 's happened to cause this phenomenon <unk>  what 's happened is that lawyers who represent death row inmates have shifted their focus to earlier and earlier chapters of the death penalty story <unk>  so twenty five years ago they focused on chapter four and they went from chapter <unk> years ago to chapter three in the late 1980s and they went from chapter three in the late 1980s to chapter two in the mid 1990s and beginning in the mid to late 1990s they began to focus on chapter one of the story <unk> now you might think that this decline in death sentences and the increase in the number of life sentences is a good thing or a bad thing i don 't want to have a conversation about that today  <unk> the earlier you intervene in a case <unk> the greater the likelihood that you 're going to save your client 's life <unk>  that 's the first thing i 've learned <unk> here 's the second thing i learned <unk> my client will was not the exception to the rule <unk> he was the rule <unk> i sometimes say if you tell me the name of a death row inmate doesn 't matter what state he 's in doesn 't matter if i 've ever met him before <unk> i 'll write his biography for you  and eight out of ten times <unk> the details of that biography will be more or less accurate  and the reason for that is that eighty percent of the people on death row are people who came from the same sort of dysfunctional family that will did  eighty percent of the people on death row are people who had exposure to the juvenile justice system <unk> that 's the second lesson that i 've learned <unk> now we 're right on the cusp of that corner where everybody 's going to agree  people in this room might disagree about whether will should have been executed <unk> but i think everybody would agree that the best possible version of his story would be a story where no murder ever occurs how do we do that when our son lincoln was working on that math problem two weeks ago it was a big gnarly problem <unk>  and he was learning how when you have a big old gnarly problem <unk> sometimes the solution is to slice it into smaller problems <unk> that 's what we do for most problems in math <unk> even in social policy we slice them into smaller more manageable problems <unk> but every once in a while as dwight eisenhower said <unk>  the way you solve a problem is to make it bigger the way we solve this problem is to make the issue of the death penalty bigger <unk>  we have to say all right we have these four chapters of a death penalty story <unk> but what happens before that <unk> story begins how can we intervene in the life of a murderer before he 's a murderer  what options do we have to nudge that person off of the path that is going to lead to a result that everybody death penalty supporters and death penalty opponents still think is a bad result the murder of an innocent human being you know sometimes people say that something isn 't rocket science <unk> and by that what they mean is rocket science is really complicated and this problem that we 're talking about now is really simple  well that 's rocket science <unk> that 's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket  what we 're talking about <unk> today is just as complicated what we 're talking about today is also rocket science my client will and eighty percent of the people on death row had five chapters in their lives that came before the four chapters of the death penalty story <unk>  i think of these five chapters as points of intervention <unk> places in their lives when our society could 've intervened in their lives and nudged them off of the path that they were on that created a consequence that <unk> <unk> we all death penalty supporters or death penalty opponents say was a bad result <unk>  <unk> in his early childhood years when he was in elementary school when he was in middle school and then high school and when he was in the juvenile justice system during each of those five chapters there were a <unk> <unk> wide variety of things that society could have done <unk> in fact if we just imagine that there are five different modes of intervention <unk> the way that society could intervene in each <unk> <unk> of those five chapters <unk> and we could mix and match them any way we want <unk> there are three thousand more than three thousand possible strategies that we could embrace in <unk> order to nudge kids like will off of the path that they 're on so i 'm not standing here today with the solution but the fact that we still have a lot to learn <unk>  that doesn 't mean that we don 't know a lot already <unk> we know from experience in other states that there are a wide variety of modes of intervention that we could be using in <unk> texas and in every other state that isn 't using them in order to prevent a consequence that we all agree is bad i 'll just mention a few <unk>  i won 't talk today about reforming the legal system <unk> that 's probably a topic that is best reserved for a room full of lawyers and judges  instead let me talk about a couple of modes of intervention that we can all help accomplish <unk> because they are modes of intervention that will come about when legislators and policymakers when taxpayers and citizens agree that that 's what we ought to be doing and that 's how we ought to be spending our money <unk>  we could be providing early childhood care for economically disadvantaged and otherwise troubled kids <unk>  and we could be doing it for free <unk> and we could be nudging kids like will off of the path that <unk> on there are other states that do that but we don 't  we could be providing special schools at both the high school level and the middle school level but even in <unk> that target economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids and particularly kids who have had exposure to the juvenile justice system <unk> there are a <unk> handful of states that do that texas doesn 't  there 's one other thing we can be doing well there are a bunch of other things there 's one other thing that i 'm going to mention and this is going to be the only controversial thing that i say today <unk>  we could be intervening much more aggressively into dangerously dysfunctional homes <unk> and getting kids out of them before their moms pick up butcher knives and threaten to <unk> if we 're going to do that we need a place to put them  even if we do all of those things some kids are going to fall through the cracks and they 're going to end up in that last chapter before the murder story begins they 're going to end up in the juvenile justice system <unk> and even if that happens  it 's not yet too late <unk> there 's still time to nudge them <unk> if we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them <unk>  there are two professors in the northeast one at yale and one at <unk> maryland they set up a school that is attached to a juvenile prison <unk>  and the kids are in prison <unk> but they go to school from eight in the morning until four in the afternoon now it was logistically difficult they had to recruit teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison <unk>  they had to establish strict separation between the people who work at the school and the prison <unk> and most dauntingly of all they needed to invent a new curriculum because you know what people don 't come into and out of prison on a semester basis  but they did all those things <unk>  now what do all of these things have in common what all of these things have in common is that they cost money <unk>  some of the people in the room might be old enough to remember the guy on the old oil filter commercial he used to say well you can pay me now or you can pay me later what we 're doing in the death penalty system is we 're paying later <unk> but the thing is that for every fifteen thousand dollars that we spend intervening in the lives of economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids in those earlier chapters <unk> we save eighty thousand dollars in crime related costs down the road even if you don 't agree that there 's a moral imperative that we do it  it just makes economic sense <unk> i want to tell you about the last conversation that i had with will <unk>  it was the day that he was going to be executed and <unk> we were just talking <unk> there was nothing left to do in his case <unk>  and we were talking about his life <unk> and he was talking first about his dad who he hardly knew who had died <unk>  and then about his mom who he did know who was still alive <unk>  and i said to him  i know the story i 've read the records <unk> i know <unk> she tried to kill you i said but i 've always wondered whether you really actually remember that i said i don 't remember anything from when i was five years old maybe you just remember somebody telling you  and he looked at me and he leaned forward <unk> and he said professor he 'd known me for twelve years he still called me professor <unk> he said professor i don 't mean any disrespect by this  but when your mama <unk> butcher knife that looks bigger than you are  and chases you through the house screaming she 's going to kill you  and you have to lock yourself in the bathroom and lean against the door and holler for help until the police get there  he looked at me and he said that 's something you don 't forget  one thing you all won 't forget <unk>  in between the time you arrived here this morning and the time we break for lunch <unk> there are going to be four homicides in the united states  we 're going to devote enormous social resources to punishing the people who commit those crimes and that 's appropriate because we should punish people who do bad things <unk>  but three of those crimes are preventable if we make the picture bigger and devote our attention to the earlier chapters <unk> then we 're never going to write the first sentence that begins the death penalty story <unk> thank you
