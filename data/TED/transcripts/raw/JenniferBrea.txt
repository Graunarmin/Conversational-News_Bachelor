 <unk> phd student at harvard <unk> and i loved to travel i had just gotten engaged to marry the love of my life <unk>  i was twenty eight and like so many of us when we are in good health <unk> i felt like i was invincible  then one day i had a fever of one hundred and four point seven degrees <unk> i probably should have gone to the doctor but i 'd never really been sick in my life and i knew that usually if you have a virus you stay home and you make some chicken soup <unk> and in a few days everything will be fine <unk>  but this time it wasn 't fine <unk>  after the fever broke for three weeks i was so dizzy i couldn 't leave my house <unk> i would walk straight into door <unk> i had to hug the walls just to make it to the bathroom  that spring i got infection after infection <unk> and every time i went to the doctor he said there was absolutely nothing wrong <unk>  he had his laboratory tests <unk> which always came back normal  all i had were my symptoms <unk> which i could describe <unk> but no one else can see <unk> know it sounds silly but you have to find a way to explain things like this to yourself and so i thought maybe i was just aging <unk> maybe this is what it 's like to be on the other side of twenty five  then the neurological symptoms started sometimes i would find that i couldn 't draw the right side of a circle other times <unk> be able to speak or move at all  i saw every kind of specialist infectious disease doctors dermatologists endocrinologists cardiologists <unk>  i even saw a psychiatrist  my psychiatrist said it 's clear you 're really sick but not with anything psychiatric <unk>  i hope they can find out what 's wrong with you  the next day my neurologist diagnosed me with conversion disorder <unk> told me that everything the fevers the sore throats the sinus infection all of the gastrointestinal neurological and cardiac symptoms were being caused by some distant emotional trauma that i could not remember  the symptoms were real he said but they had no biological cause  i was training to be a social scientist <unk> i had studied <unk> statistics probability theory mathematical modeling experimental design <unk>  i felt like i couldn 't just reject my neurologist 's diagnosis <unk>  it didn 't feel true <unk> but i knew from my training that the truth is often counterintuitive  so easily obscured by what we want to believe <unk> so i had to consider the possibility that he was right <unk> that day i ran a small experiment i walked back the two miles from my neurologist 's office to my house  my legs wrapped in this strange <unk> almost electric kind of pain <unk>  i meditated on that pain <unk> contemplating how my mind could have possibly generated all this  <unk> as soon as i walked through the door i collapsed my brain and my spinal cord were burning  my neck was so stiff i couldn 't touch my chin to my chest and the slightest sound the rustling of the sheets my husband walking barefoot in the next room could cause excruciating pain <unk>  i would spend most of the next two years in bed <unk> how could my doctor have gotten it so wrong  i thought i had a rare disease <unk> something doctors had never seen and then i went online and found thousands of people all over the world living with the same symptoms <unk> similarly isolated <unk> similarly disbelieved <unk>  some could still work but had to spend their evenings and weekends in bed just so they could show up the next <unk> the other end of the spectrum some were so sick they had to live in complete darkness <unk> unable to tolerate the sound of a human voice or the touch of a loved one  i was diagnosed with <unk> you 've probably heard it called chronic fatigue syndrome for decades that 's a <unk> that 's meant that this has been the dominant image of a disease that can be as serious as this  the key symptom we all share is that whenever we exert ourselves physically <unk> mentally we pay and we pay hard <unk>  if my husband goes for a run he might be sore for a couple of days <unk> if i try to walk half a block <unk> i might be bedridden for a week  it is a perfect custom prison <unk>  i know ballet dancers who can 't dance <unk> dance <unk> accountants who can 't add <unk> medical students who never became doctors  it doesn 't matter what you once were you can 't do it anymore  it 's been four years and i 've still never been as well as i was the minute before i walked home from my neurologist 's office <unk>  it 's estimated that about fifteen to thirty million people around the world have this disease in the us where i 'm from it 's about one million people that makes it roughly twice as common as multiple sclerosis  patients can live for decades with the physical function of someone with congestive heart failure <unk> twenty five percent of us are homebound or bedridden and <unk> <unk> yet doctors do not treat us and science does not study us <unk> how could a disease this common and this devastating have been forgotten by medicine  when my doctor diagnosed me with conversion disorder <unk> he was invoking a lineage of ideas about women 's bodies that are over two thousand five hundred years old  the roman physician galen thought that hysteria was caused by sexual deprivation in particularly <unk> passionate women  the greeks thought the uterus would literally dry up and wander around the body in search of moisture <unk> pressing on internal organs yes causing symptoms from extreme emotions to dizziness and paralysis the cure was marriage and motherhood <unk> these ideas went largely unchanged for several millennia until the 1880s when neurologists tried to modernize the theory of hysteria <unk>  sigmund freud developed a theory that the unconscious mind could produce physical symptoms when dealing with memories or emotions too painful for the conscious mind to handle  it converted these emotions into physical symptoms  this meant that men could now get hysteria but of course women were still the most susceptible <unk> when i began investigating the history of my own disease <unk> i was amazed to find how deep these ideas still run in one thousand  nine hundred and thirty four one hundred and ninety eight doctors nurses and staff at the los angeles county general hospital became seriously ill they had muscle weakness <unk> stiffness in the neck and back fevers all of the same symptoms i had when i first got diagnosed  <unk> form of polio <unk> since then there have been more than seventy outbreaks documented around the world of a strikingly similar <unk> post infectious disease  all of these outbreaks have tended to disproportionately affect women <unk>  and in time when doctors failed to find the one cause of the disease <unk> they thought that these outbreaks were mass hysteria  why has this idea had such staying power <unk> i do think it has to do with sexism but i also think that fundamentally doctors want to help <unk> they want to know the answer  and this category allows doctors to treat what would otherwise be untreatable to explain illnesses that have no explanation <unk>  the problem is that this can cause real harm in the 1950s a psychiatrist named eliot slater studied a cohort who had been diagnosed with hysteria <unk>  nine years later twelve of them were dead and thirty had become disabled  many had undiagnosed conditions like multiple sclerosis <unk> epilepsy brain tumors  in one thousand nine hundred and eighty hysteria was officially renamed conversion disorder when my neurologist gave me that diagnosis in two thousand and <unk> he was echoing freud 's words verbatim <unk> and even today women are two to ten times more likely to receive that diagnosis <unk>  the problem with the theory of hysteria or psychogenic illness is that it can never be proven it is by definition the absence of evidence <unk>  and in the case of me psychological explanations have held back biological research  all around the world me is one of the least funded diseases in the us <unk> us <unk> we spend each year roughly two thousand five hundred dollars per aids patient two hundred and fifty dollars per ms patient and just five dollars per year per me patient <unk>  this was not just lightning <unk> i was not just unlucky <unk>  the ignorance surrounding my disease has been a choice a choice made by the institutions that were supposed to protect us <unk> us  we don 't know why me sometimes runs in families <unk>  why you can get it after almost any infection from enteroviruses to epstein barr virus to q fever  or why it affects women at two to three times the rate of men  this issue is much bigger than just my disease <unk> when i first got <unk> old friends were reaching out to me <unk> i soon found myself a part of a cohort of women in their late 20s whose bodies were falling apart  what was striking was just how much trouble we were having being taken seriously <unk>  i learned of one woman with scleroderma <unk> an autoimmune connective tissue disease who was told for years that it was all in her head  between the time of onset and diagnosis <unk> her esophagus was so thoroughly damaged <unk> she will never be able to eat again another woman with ovarian cancer who for years was told that it was just early menopause  a friend from college <unk> whose brain tumor was misdiagnosed for years as anxiety <unk>  here 's why this worries me <unk> since the <unk> rates of many autoimmune diseases have doubled to tripled <unk> of patients who are eventually diagnosed with a recognized autoimmune disease are initially told they 're hypochondriacs  like the hysteria of old this has everything to do with gender and with whose stories we believe seventy five percent of autoimmune disease patients are women <unk> and in some diseases it 's as high as ninety percent  even though these diseases disproportionately affect women they are not women 's diseases me affects children and me affects millions of men as one patient told me we get it coming and going if you 're a woman you 're told you 're exaggerating your symptoms <unk> but if you 're a guy you 're told to be strong to buck up  and men may even have a more difficult time getting diagnosed  my brain <unk> is not what it used <unk> here 's the good part <unk> despite everything i still have <unk> so many diseases were once thought of as psychological until science uncovered their biological mechanisms  patients with epilepsy could be forcibly institutionalized until the eeg was able to measure abnormal electrical activity in the brain  multiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosed as hysterical paralysis until the cat scan and the mri discovered brain lesions <unk>  and recently we used to think that stomach ulcers were just caused by stress until we discovered that h pylori was the culprit me has never benefited from the kind of science that other diseases have had but that 's starting to change  in germany scientists are starting to find evidence of autoimmunity and in japan of brain inflammation  in the us scientists at stanford are finding abnormalities in energy metabolism that are <unk> sixteen standard deviations away from normal <unk>  and in norway <unk> researchers are running a phase 3 clinical trial on a cancer drug that in some patients causes complete remission  what also gives me hope is the resilience of patients online we came <unk> and we shared our stories  we devoured what research there was we experimented on ourselves <unk>  we became our own scientists and our own doctors because we had to be  and slowly i added five percent here five percent there until eventually on a good day i was able to leave my home <unk>  i still had to make ridiculous choices <unk> will i sit in the garden for fifteen minutes or will i wash <unk> my hair today <unk> but it gave me hope that i could be treated <unk> i had a sick body that was all  and with the right kind of help <unk> maybe one day i could get better <unk> i came together with patients around the world <unk> and we started to fight <unk>  we have filled the void with something wonderful <unk> but it is not enough <unk> i still don 't know if i will ever be able to run again  or walk at any distance or do any of those kinetic things that i now only get to do in my dreams <unk>  but i am so grateful for how far i have come  progress is slow <unk> and it is up and it is <unk> but i am getting a little better each day  i remember what it was like when i was stuck in that bedroom <unk> when it had been months since i had seen the sun <unk>  i thought that i would die there <unk>  but here i am today with you and that is a miracle <unk> i don 't know what would have happened had i not been one of the lucky ones had i gotten sick before the internet had i not found my community <unk>  i probably would have already taken my own life <unk> as so many others have done  how many lives could we have saved <unk> decades ago <unk> if we had asked the right questions <unk>  how many lives could we save today if we decide to make a real start <unk> start  even once the true cause of my disease is discovered  if we don 't change our institutions and our culture <unk> we will do this again to another disease <unk>  living with this illness has taught me that science and medicine are profoundly human endeavors  doctors scientists and policy makers are not immune to the same biases that affect <unk> all of us  we need to think in more nuanced ways about women 's health  our immune systems are just as much a battleground for equality as the rest of our bodies we need to listen to patients ' stories <unk>  and we need to be willing to say i don 't know  i don 't know is a beautiful thing i don 't know is where discovery <unk> starts <unk>  and if we can do that  if we can approach the great vastness of all that we do not know <unk> and then rather than fear uncertainty <unk> maybe we can greet it with a sense of wonder <unk> thank you
