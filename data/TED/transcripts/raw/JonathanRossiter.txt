 <unk> know what a robot is right <unk> if you don 't you 'd probably go to google and you 'd ask google what a robot is <unk> so let 's do that  we 'll go to google and this is what we get now <unk> you can see lots of different types of robots <unk> but they 're predominantly humanoid in structure <unk>  and they look pretty conventional because they 've got plastic they 've got metal they 've got motors and gears and so on  some of them look quite friendly <unk> and you could go up and you could hug them <unk>  some of them not so friendly <unk> they look like they 're straight out of terminator in fact they may well be straight out of <unk> you can do lots of really cool things with these robots you can do really exciting stuff  but i 'd like to look at different kinds of robots i want to make different kinds of robots  and i take inspiration from the things that don 't look like us <unk> but look like these  so these are natural biological organisms and they do some really cool things that we can 't and current robots can 't either <unk> they do all sorts of great things like moving around on the floor they go into our gardens and they eat our crops <unk> they climb trees they go in water they come out of water <unk> they trap insects and digest them <unk> so they do really interesting things they live they breathe <unk>  they die <unk> they eat things from the environment our current robots don 't really do that <unk> now wouldn 't it be great if you could use some of those characteristics in future robots so that you could solve some really interesting problems i 'm going to look at a couple of problems now <unk> in the environment where we can use the skills and the technologies derived from these animals and from the plants and we can use them to solve those problems <unk> let 's have a look at two environmental problems they 're both of our making this is man interacting with the environment and doing some rather unpleasant things the first one is to do with the pressure of population <unk>  such is the pressure of population around <unk> world that agriculture and farming is required to produce more and more crops <unk> now to do that <unk> farmers put more and more chemicals onto the land <unk> they put on fertilizers nitrates <unk> <unk> pesticides all sorts of things that encourage the growth of the crops <unk>  and then when it rains  these chemicals go into the water table and in the water table <unk> then they go into streams into lakes into rivers and into the sea  now if you put all of these chemicals these nitrates <unk> into those kinds of environments there are organisms in those environments that will be affected by that algae for example algae loves nitrates it loves fertilizer so it will take in all <unk> these chemicals and if the conditions are right it will mass produce it will produce masses and masses of new algae <unk> that 's called a bloom <unk>  the trouble is that when algae reproduces like this <unk> it starves the water of oxygen as soon as you do that the other organisms in the water can 't survive <unk>  so what do we do <unk> we try to produce a robot that will eat the algae <unk> consume it and make it safe <unk> so that 's the first problem <unk>  the second problem is also of our making <unk> and it 's to do with oil pollution <unk>  now oil comes out of the engines that we use the boats that we use sometimes tankers flush their oil tanks into the sea so oil is released into the sea that way wouldn 't it be nice if we could treat that in some way using robots that could eat the pollution the oil fields have <unk> produced <unk> so that 's what we do we make robots that will eat pollution to actually make the robot we take inspiration from two organisms on the right there you see the basking shark the basking shark is a massive shark it <unk> can swim with it as you can see and the basking shark opens its mouth and it swims through the water <unk> collecting plankton <unk> it does that it digests the food <unk> and then it uses that energy in its body to keep moving  so could we make a robot like that like the basking shark that chugs through the water and eats up pollution <unk>  well <unk> let 's see if we can do that but also we take the inspiration from other organisms i 've got a picture here of a water boatman and the water boatman is really cute  when it 's swimming in the water it uses its <unk> push itself forward <unk> so we take those two organisms and we combine them together to make a new kind of robot  in fact because we 're using the water boatman as inspiration <unk> and our robot sits on top of the water and it rows <unk> we call it the <unk> <unk> so a row bot is a robot that rows ok so what does it look like here 's some pictures of the <unk> see it doesn 't look anything like the robots we saw right at the beginning google is wrong robots don 't look like that <unk> they look like this <unk> so i 've got the row bot here i 'll just hold it up for you it gives you a sense of the scale <unk> and it doesn 't look anything like the others <unk>  ok <unk> so it 's made out of plastic and we 'll have a look now at the components that make up the <unk> row bot what <unk> is made up of three parts and those three parts are really like the parts of any organism <unk> it 's got a brain <unk> it 's got a body and it 's got a stomach <unk> <unk> it needs the stomach to create the energy any row bot will have those three components <unk> and any organism will have those three components <unk> so let 's go through them one at a time <unk> <unk> it 's got flippers on the side here paddles that help it move <unk> just like the water boatman <unk>  it 's got a plastic body but it 's got a soft rubber mouth mouth here and a mouth here it 's got two mouths <unk> why does it have two mouths <unk> one is to let the food go in and the other is to let the food go out <unk> so you can see really it 's got a mouth and a derriere <unk> something where the stuff comes out which is just like a real organism <unk> so it 's starting to look like that basking shark <unk> so that 's the body <unk>  the second component might be the stomach we need to get the energy into the robot and we need to treat the pollution so the pollution goes in and it will do something <unk> it 's got a cell in the middle here called a microbial fuel cell i 'll put this down and i 'll lift up the fuel cell here <unk> so instead of having batteries instead of having <unk> power system <unk> it 's got one of these this is its stomach <unk>  and it really is a stomach because you can put energy in this side in the form of pollution <unk> and it creates electricity <unk> so what is it it 's called a microbial fuel cell <unk> it 's a little bit like <unk> <unk> a chemical fuel cell which you might have come across in school or you might 've seen in the news chemical fuel cells take hydrogen and oxygen <unk> and they can combine them together and you get electricity  <unk> technology it was in the apollo space missions that 's from forty fifty years ago  this is slightly newer this is a microbial fuel cell <unk> it 's the same principle it 's got oxygen on one side but instead of having hydrogen on the other it 's got some soup <unk>  and inside that soup there are living microbes <unk> now <unk> if you take some organic material could be some <unk> the microbes will eat that food and they will turn it into electricity  not only that but if you select the right kind of microbes <unk> you can use the microbial fuel cell to treat some of the pollution <unk>  if you choose the right microbes <unk> the microbes will eat the algae <unk> if you use other kinds of microbes <unk> they will eat petroleum <unk> so you can see how this stomach could be used to not only treat the pollution but also to generate electricity from the pollution <unk>  so the robot will move through the environment taking food into its stomach  digest the food create electricity use that electricity to move through the environment and keep doing this ok <unk> so let 's see what happens when we run the row bot when it does some rowing <unk> here we 've got a couple of videos the first thing <unk> you can see here is the mouth open the front mouth and the bottom mouth open <unk>  and it will stay opened enough then the robot will start to row forward <unk> it moves through the water so that food goes in as the waste products go out <unk> once it 's moved enough it stops and then it closes the mouth slowly closes the mouths and then it will sit there and it will digest the food of course these microbial fuel cells they contain microbes what you really want is lots of energy coming out of those microbes as quickly as possible  but we can 't force the microbes and they generate a small amount of electricity per second they generate <unk> let 's put that into context your mobile phone for example one of these modern ones if you use it it takes about one watt <unk> so that 's a thousand or a million <unk> times as much energy that that uses compared to the microbial fuel cell how can we cope with that <unk> well <unk> when the row bot has done its digestion when it 's taken the food in it will sit there and it will wait until it has consumed all that food that could take some hours <unk> it could take some days <unk> a typical cycle for the <unk> looks like this <unk>  you open your mouth you move <unk> you close your mouth and you sit there for a while waiting <unk>  once you digest your food then you can go about doing the same thing again <unk>  but you know what that looks like a real organism doesn 't it it looks like the kind of thing we do saturday night we go out open our mouths <unk> fill our stomachs  sit in front of the telly and digest <unk>  when we 've had enough we do the same thing again <unk> <unk> if we 're lucky with this cycle at the end of the cycle we 'll have enough energy left over for us to be able to do something else <unk> we could send a message for example <unk> we could send a message <unk> <unk> saying this is how much pollution i 've eaten recently or this is the kind of stuff that i 've encountered or this is where i am <unk>  <unk> if you think about the oil slicks that we saw before or those massive algal blooms what you really want to do is put your row bot out there and it eats up all of those pollutions <unk> and then you have to go collect them <unk> why because these row bots at the moment <unk> this row bot i 've got here it contains motors <unk> it contains wires it contains components which themselves are not biodegradable  current row bots contain things like toxic batteries you can 't leave those in the environment <unk> so you need to track them <unk> and then when they 've finished their job of work you need to collect them that limits the number of row bots you can use  if on the other hand you have robot a little bit like a biological organism <unk> when it comes to the end of its life it dies and it degrades to nothing <unk>  so wouldn 't it be nice if these robots <unk> instead of being like this made out of plastic were made out of other materials <unk> which when you throw them out there they biodegrade <unk> that changes the way in which we use robots <unk> instead of putting ten or one hundred out into the environment having to track them <unk> and then when they die <unk> collect them  you could put a thousand a million a billion robots into the environment just spread them around  you know that at the end of their lives they 're going to degrade to nothing you don 't need to worry about them <unk> so that changes the way in which you think about robots and the way you <unk> then the question is can you do this well yes we have shown that you can do this you can make robots which are biodegradable <unk> what 's really interesting is you can use household materials to make these biodegradable robots i 'll show you some you might be surprised  you can make a robot out of jelly <unk> instead of having a motor <unk> which we have at the moment <unk> you can make things called artificial muscles artificial muscles are smart <unk> you apply electricity to them <unk> and they contract or they bend or they twist they look like real muscles <unk>  so instead of having a motor you have these artificial muscles and you can make artificial muscles out of jelly if you take some jelly and some salts and <unk> you can make an artificial muscle we 've also shown you can make the microbial fuel cell 's stomach out of paper <unk>  so you could make the whole robot out of biodegradable materials <unk> you throw them out there and they degrade to nothing <unk> well <unk> this is really really exciting it 's going to totally change the way in which we think about robots <unk>  but also it allows you to be really creative in the way in which you think about what you can do with these robots i 'll give you an example <unk> if you can use jelly to make a robot now we eat jelly right so why not make something like this  <unk> thinks <unk> it twists it bends it does something <unk> it could go further down into your intestines <unk> find out whether you 've got some ulcer or cancer <unk> maybe do an injection something like that  you know that once it 's done its job of work <unk> it could be consumed by your stomach <unk>  or if you don 't want that <unk> it could go straight through you into the toilet <unk> and be degraded safely in the environment <unk>  so this changes the way again in which we think about robots so we started off looking at robots that would eat pollution <unk> and then we 're looking at robots which we can eat  i hope this gives you some idea of the kinds of things we can do with future robots <unk>  thank you very much for your attention
