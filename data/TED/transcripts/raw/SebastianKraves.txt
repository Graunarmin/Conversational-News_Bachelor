 <unk> that you 're a pig farmer <unk> you live on a small farm in the philippines your animals are your family 's sole source of income as long as they 're healthy you know <unk> one of your pigs can catch the flu the swine flu  living in tight quarters one pig coughing and sneezing may soon lead to the next pig coughing and sneezing until an outbreak of swine flu has taken over your farm  if it 's a bad enough virus the health of your herd may be gone in the blink of an eye  if you called in a veterinarian he or she would visit your farm and take samples from your pigs <unk> ' noses and mouths <unk> but then they would have to drive back into the city to test those <unk> samples in their central lab  two weeks later you 'd hear back the results <unk>  two weeks may be just enough time for infection to spread and take away your way of life <unk>  but it doesn 't have to be that way today <unk> farmers can take those samples themselves they can jump right into the pen and swab their pigs ' noses and mouths with a little filter paper place that little filter paper <unk> in a tiny tube and mix it with some chemicals that will extract genetic material from their pigs <unk> ' noses and mouths <unk> and without leaving their farms they take a drop of that genetic material and put it into a little analyzer smaller than a shoebox program it to detect dna or rna from the swine flu virus and within one hour get back the results visualize the results <unk> this reality is possible because today we 're living in the era of personal dna technology every one of us can actually test dna ourselves  dna is the fundamental molecule the carries genetic instructions that help build the living world  humans have dna pigs have dna even bacteria and some viruses have dna too the genetic instructions <unk> encoded in dna inform how our bodies develop <unk> grow function and in many cases that same information can trigger disease  your genetic information is strung into a long and twisted molecule the dna double helix that has over three billion letters <unk> beginning to end <unk>  but the lines that carry meaningful information are usually very short a few dozen to several <unk> thousand letters long so when we 're looking to answer a question based on dna we actually don 't need to read all those three billion letters typically  that would be like getting hungry at night and having to flip through the whole phone book from cover to cover <unk> pausing at every line just to find the nearest pizza joint  laughter luckily <unk> three decades ago <unk> humans started to invent tools that can find any specific line of genetic information these dna machines are wonderful they can find <unk> any line in dna but once they find it that dna is still tiny <unk>  <unk> out against the rest <unk> until we can visualize it <unk> interpret it read it <unk> understand it <unk> until we can answer <unk> does my pig have the flu  or other questions buried in our own dna <unk> am i at risk of cancer <unk> am i of irish descent is that <unk> to make copies of dna as simple as it sounds has transformed our world scientists use it every day to detect and address disease to create innovative medicines to modify foods to assess whether our food is safe to eat or whether it 's contaminated with <unk> even judges use the output of these machines in court to decide whether someone is innocent or guilty based on dna evidence the inventor of this dna copying technique was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in <unk> but for thirty years the power of genetic analysis has been confined to the ivory tower <unk> or bigwig phd scientist work well several companies around the world are working on making this same technology accessible to everyday people like the pig farmer like you  i cofounded one of these companies  three years ago <unk> together with a fellow biologist and friend of mine zeke alvarez saavedra <unk> we decided to make personal dna machines that anyone could use  our goal was to bring dna science to more people in new places we started working in our basements we had a simple <unk> question what could the world look like if everyone could analyze dna we were curious as curious as you would have been if i had shown you this picture in one thousand nine hundred and eighty  you would have thought wow i can now call my aunt glenda from the car and wish her a happy birthday <unk> i can <unk> little did you know you would tap on that phone to make dinner reservations for you and aunt glenda to celebrate together with another tap you 'd be ordering her gift and yet one more tap <unk> <unk> and you 'd be liking auntie glenda on facebook and all of this while sitting on the toilet  laughter it is notoriously hard to predict where new technology might take us and the same is true for personal <unk> dna technology today for example <unk> i could never have imagined that a truffle farmer of all people would use personal dna machines dr paul thomas grows truffles for a living we see him pictured here <unk> holding the first truffle in his hands on one of his <unk> truffles are this delicacy that stems from a fungus growing on the roots of living trees <unk> and it 's a rare fungus some species may fetch three thousand seven thousand or more dollars per kilogram <unk>  i learned from paul that the stakes for a truffle farmer can be really high when he sources new truffles to grow on his farms <unk>  he 's exposed to the threat of knockoffs truffles that look and feel like the real thing <unk> but they 're of lower quality <unk> but even to a trained eye like paul 's even when looked at under a microscope these truffles can pass for authentic <unk> so in order to grow the highest quality truffles the ones that chefs all over the world will fight over paul has to use dna analysis  isn 't that mind blowing  i bet you will never look at that black truffle risotto again without thinking of its genes but personal dna machines can also save human lives <unk> professor ian goodfellow is a virologist at the university of cambridge <unk> <unk> last year he traveled to sierra leone when the ebola outbreak broke out in western africa he quickly realized that doctors there lacked the basic tools to detect and combat disease <unk> could take up to a week to come back that 's way too long for the patients and the families who are suffering <unk>  ian decided to move his lab into makeni sierra leone  here we see ian goodfellow moving over ten tons of equipment into a pop up tent that he would equip to detect and diagnose the virus and sequence it within but here 's a surprise the same equipment that ian could use at his lab in the uk to sequence and diagnose ebola  just wouldn 't work under these conditions we 're talking thirty five celsius heat and over ninety percent humidity here <unk>  but instead ian could use personal dna machines small enough to be <unk> to keep sequencing the virus and keep saving lives this may seem like an extreme place for dna analysis but let 's move on to an even more extreme environment <unk>  outer space <unk>  let 's talk about dna analysis in space  when astronauts live aboard the international space station they 're orbiting the planet two hundred and fifty miles high <unk> they 're traveling <unk> at seventeen thousand miles per hour picture that you 're seeing fifteen sunsets and sunrises every day you 're also living in microgravity <unk> floating  and under these conditions our bodies can do funky things one of these things is that our immune systems get suppressed  making astronauts more prone to infection girl a high school student from new york <unk> to the dna of astronauts could be related to this immune suppression <unk> and through a science competition called genes in space anna sophia designed an experiment to test this <unk> <unk> hypothesis using a personal dna machine aboard the international space station <unk>  <unk> international space station that cloud of smoke is the rocket that brought anna sophia 's experiment to the international space station  where three days later <unk> astronaut tim peake carried out her experiment in microgravity  personal dna machines are now aboard the international space station where they can help monitor living conditions and protect the lives of astronauts a <unk> <unk> designing a dna experiment to protect the lives of astronauts may seem like a rarity <unk>  the mark of a child genius <unk> well to me it signals something bigger  that dna technology is finally within the reach of every one of you  a few years ago a college student armed with a personal computer <unk> could code an app an app that is now a social network with more than one billion users  could we be moving into a world of one personal dna machine in every home  i know families who are already living in this reality the daniels family for example set up a dna lab in the basement <unk> of their suburban chicago home  this is not a family made of phd scientists  this is a family like any other they just like to spend time together doing fun <unk> creative things by day <unk> brian is an executive at a private equity firm  at night and on weekends he experiments with dna alongside his kids <unk> ages seven and nine <unk> as a way to explore the living world <unk> <unk> last time i called them they were checking out homegrown produce from the backyard garden <unk>  they were testing tomatoes that they had picked taking the flesh of their skin putting it in a test tube <unk> mixing it with chemicals to extract dna and then using <unk> <unk> their home dna copier to test those tomatoes for genetically engineered traits for the daniels family the personal dna machine is like <unk> most of us may not yet be diagnosing genetic conditions in our kitchen sinks or doing at home paternity testing but we 've definitely reached a point in history where every one of you could actually get hands on with dna in your kitchen you could copy paste and analyze dna and extract meaningful information from it and it 's at times like this that <unk> profound transformation is bound to happen moments when a transformative powerful technology that was before limited to a select few in the ivory tower <unk> finally becomes within the reach of every one of us  from farmers to schoolchildren <unk>  think about the moment when phones stopped being plugged into the wall by cords or when computers left the mainframe and entered your <unk> home or your office <unk>  the ripples of the personal dna revolution may be hard to predict <unk> but one thing is certain <unk>  revolutions don 't go backwards and dna technology is already spreading faster than our imagination <unk> so if you 're curious get up close and personal with dna today  it is in our dna to be curious
