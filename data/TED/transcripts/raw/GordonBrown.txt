 <unk> can i say how delighted i am to be away from the the calm of westminster and whitehall <unk> napalm <unk> and she awakened the conscience of the nation of america to begin to end the vietnam war  this is birhan who was the ethiopian girl who launched live aid in the <unk> fifteen minutes away from death when she was rescued and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world <unk> this is tiananmen square a man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance this next is the sudanese girl a few moments from from death a vulture hovering in <unk> a picture that went round the world and shocked people into action on poverty this is neda <unk> the iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in iran only a few weeks ago <unk> and she is now the focus <unk> rightly so of the youtube generation <unk> and what do all these pictures and events have in common what they have in common is <unk> what we see unlocks what we cannot see what we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community what these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others <unk> however distantly <unk> what i think these <unk> pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves  what these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions across all faiths  across all continents a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others <unk> and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong <unk> that need righted see injuries that need to be corrected see problems that need to be rectified there is a story about olof palme the swedish prime minister going to see ronald reagan in america in the 1980s before he arrived ronald reagan said and he was the swedish social democratic prime minister isnt this man a communist <unk> and ronald reagan said i dont care what kind of communist he is laughter ronald reagan asked olof palme <unk> the social democratic prime minister of sweden well what do you believe in do you want to abolish the rich he said no  i want to abolish the poor our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full i believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith <unk> and people of no faith <unk> but i think what 's new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world we now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet <unk> who we will meet through the internet and through all the modern means of communication that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with and i believe that this makes this a unique age in human history and it is the start of what i would call the creation of a truly global society <unk> go back two hundred years when the slave trade was under pressure from william wilberforce and all the protesters <unk>  they protested across britain <unk> they won public opinion over a long period of time <unk>  but it took twenty four years for the campaign to be successful  what could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication <unk> to win peoples hearts and minds or if you take eglantyne jebb <unk> the woman who created save the children ninety years ago <unk>  she was so appalled by what was happening in austria as a result of the first world war and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of austria that in britain she wanted to take action but she had to go house to house <unk> to leaflet to get people to attend a rally in the royal albert hall that eventually gave birth to save the children an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world <unk> but what more could she have done if shed had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately now look at whats happened <unk> in the last ten years in philippines in two thousand and one president estrada a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime eventually brought it down and it was of course called the coup de text then you have in zimbabwe the first election under robert mugabe a year ago <unk> because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening <unk> at the polling stations it was impossible for that premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do  or take burma and the monks that were blogging out a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening until these blogs told the world that there was a repression meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted <unk> is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world <unk> had to be listened to then take iran itself and what people are doing today <unk>  following what happened to neda  people who are preventing the security services of iran finding those people who are blogging out of iran any by everybody who is blogging changing their address to tehran <unk> and making it difficult for the security services take therefore what modern technology is capable of the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally that in my view <unk> gives us the first opportunity as a community to fundamentally change the world foreign policy can never be the same again it cannot be run by elites its got to be run by listening to <unk> the public opinions of peoples who are blogging who are communicating with each other around the world two hundred years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery one hundred and fifty years ago i suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people children had the right to education one hundred years ago in most countries in in europe <unk> the pressure was for the right to vote fifty years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare in the last 50 60 years we have seen fascism anti semitism racism  apartheid <unk> discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world <unk>  i was with nelson mandela a year ago when he was in london i was at a concert that he was <unk> attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation i was sitting next to nelson mandela i was very privileged to do so when amy winehouse came onto the stage  and nelson mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and i was explaining <unk> nelson mandela and i have a lot in common <unk> my husband too has spent a long time in prison laughter nelson mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized the challenge for us all he said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain the mountain of challenging and <unk> then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid he said that there was a greater challenge ahead  the challenge of poverty of climate change global challenges that needed global solutions and needed the creation of a truly global society we are the first generation which is in a position <unk> the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally  with the challenges that we now face  most of which are global in their nature climate change cannot be solved in one country <unk> but has got to be solved by the world working together a financial crisis just as we have seen could not be solved by america alone or europe alone <unk> it needed the world to work together <unk>  take the problems of security and terrorism and equally the problem of human rights and development <unk> they cannot be solved by africa alone <unk> they cannot be solved by america or europe alone  we cannot solve these problems unless we work together <unk> so the great project of our generation it seems to me  is to build for the first time out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize <unk> a truly global society <unk>  built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future <unk> we have now and are the first generation with the power to do this  take climate change is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem  where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that when we want to create a global carbon market <unk>  but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem one of the things that has got to come out of copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement <unk> that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations take the financial crisis if people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in new york or starts in the sub prime market of the united states of america  if people can find that that sub prime product has been transferred across nations many many times until it ends up in banks in iceland or the rest in britain and people 's ordinary savings are affected by it  then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision you need in the long run for <unk> for economic growth for jobs as well as for financial stability global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared <unk> and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years then take development <unk> partnership we need between our countries and the rest of the world the poorest part of the world <unk>  we do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future <unk> and yet out of peoples desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done  i have just been talking to the president of sierra leone <unk> this is a country of six and a half million people  but it has only eighty doctors  it has two hundred nurses it has one hundred and twenty midwives you cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources or take the girl i met when i was in tanzania a girl called miriam <unk>  she was eleven years old her parents had both died from aids <unk> mother and then her father she was an aids orphan being handed across different extended families to be to be cared for she herself was suffering from hiv <unk> she was suffering from tuberculosis i met her in a field she was ragged she had no shoes  when you looked in her eyes <unk> any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future <unk>  but there was an unreachable sadness in that girls eyes and if i could have translated that to the rest of the world for that <unk> moment i believe that all the work that it had done for the global hiv aids fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations we must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire <unk> that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture so that africa is not a net importer of food but an exporter of food <unk> rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world <unk> burma is in chains zimbabwe is a human tragedy in sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent  in the rwanda children 's museum there is a <unk> and the children 's museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the rwandan genocide where a million people died there is a photograph of a boy called david beside that photograph there is the information about his life it said <unk> last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death don 't worry <unk> the united nations are coming  and we never did <unk> and that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in rwanda <unk> never did  so we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict ridden states of the world <unk>  so my argument today is basically this  we have the means by which we could create a truly global society <unk> the institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors that global <unk> ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work but we should not lose the chance in this generation in this decade in particular with president obama in america with other people working with us around the world  to create global institutions for the environment and for finance and for security and for development that make sense of our responsibility to other our desire to bind the world together and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist it is said that in ancient rome that when cicero spoke to his audiences people used to turn to each other and say about cicero great speech but it is said that in ancient greece when demosthenes spoke to his audiences people turned to each other and didnt say <unk> great speech they said let 's march we should be marching towards a global society <unk> thank you
