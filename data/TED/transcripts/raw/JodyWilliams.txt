 <unk> to make a challenge to people i know there have been many challenges made to people the one i 'm going to make is that it is time for us to reclaim what peace <unk> is not the dove and the rainbow as lovely as they are <unk>  when i see the symbols of the rainbow and the dove <unk> i think of personal serenity <unk>  i think of meditation <unk>  i do not think about what i consider to be peace which is sustainable peace with justice and equality <unk> it is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives  where these people have enough access to education and health care so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear this is called human security <unk>  and i am not a complete pacifist like some of my really really <unk> <unk> non violent friends like mairead mcguire <unk> i understand that humans are so messed up to use <unk> i 'm trying harder and harder mom i 'm really trying <unk>  we need a little bit of police we need a little bit of military but for defense <unk>  we need to redefine what makes us secure in this world <unk> it is not arming our country to <unk> other countries to arm themselves to the teeth with the weapons that we produce and we sell them <unk>  it is using that money more rationally to make the countries of the world secure to make the people of the world secure <unk>  i was thinking about <unk> the recent ongoings in congress where the president is offering eight point four billion dollars to try to get the start vote <unk> i certainly support the start vote  but he 's offering eighty four billion dollars for the for the modernizing of nuclear weapons do you know the figure that the u n talks about for fulfilling the millennium development goals is eighty billion <unk> dollars  just that little bit of money which to me i wish it was in my bank account it 's not  but in global terms it 's a little bit of money <unk>  but it 's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime unless we get up off our  and take action to make it happen <unk> unless we begin to believe that all of the things that we 've been hearing about in these last two days are elements of what come together to make human security <unk> it is saving the tigers <unk> it is stopping the tar sands <unk> it is having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have <unk> cancer <unk> it is all of those things <unk> it is using our money for all of those things <unk> it is about action <unk>  i was in hiroshima a couple of weeks ago and his holiness we 're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city and there were about eight of us nobel laureates and he 's a bad guy he 's like a bad kid in church we 're staring at everybody waiting our turn to speak and he leans over to <unk> me and he says jody i 'm a buddhist monk  i said yes <unk> your holiness <unk> your robe gives it away  he said you know that i kind of like meditation and i pray i said  that 's good that 's good <unk> we need that in the world <unk> i don 't follow that but that 's cool but i have become skeptical <unk> i do not believe that meditation and prayer will change this world <unk>  i think what we need is action his holiness in his robes is my new action hero <unk>  i spoke with aung sun suu kyi a couple of days ago as most of you know <unk> 's a hero for democracy in her country burma you probably also know that she has spent fifteen of the last twenty years imprisoned for her efforts to bring about democracy <unk>  she was just released a couple of weeks ago and we 're very concerned to see how long she will be free because she is already out in the streets in rangoon agitating for change <unk> she is already out in the streets working <unk> with the party to try to rebuild it but i talked to her for a range of issues but one thing that i want to say because it 's similar to what his holiness said <unk>  she said you know we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country <unk> but i don 't believe in hope <unk> i don 't believe in the hope of change <unk> unless we take action to make it so  here 's another woman hero of mine she 's my friend dr shirin ebadi the first muslim woman to receive the nobel peace prize <unk> she has been in exile for the last year and a half you ask her <unk> where she lives where does she live in exile she says the airports of the world <unk>  <unk> traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections <unk>  and instead of going home she conferred with all the other women that she works with who said to her stay out we need you out we need to be able to talk to you out there so that you can give the message of what 's happening here  a year and a half she 's out speaking on behalf of the other women in her country <unk> wangari maathai two thousand and four peace laureate they call her the tree lady but she 's more than the tree lady <unk>  working for peace is very creative  it 's hard work every day <unk> when she was planting those trees i don 't think most people understand that at the same <unk> she was using the action of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country  people could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail <unk> but if they were together planting trees for the environment  it was okay creativity <unk>  but it 's not just iconic women like shirin like aung sun suu kyi like wangari maathai it is other women in the world who are also struggling together to change this world the women 's league of burma <unk> eleven individual organizations of burmese women came together because there 's strength in numbers working together <unk> is what changes our world the million signatures campaign of women inside burma <unk> working together to change human rights to bring democracy to that country <unk> when one is arrested and taken to prison another one comes out and joins the movement <unk>  recognizing that if they work together they will ultimately bring change in their own country <unk>  mairead mcguire in the middle betty <unk> the quick story  an ira driver was shot and his car plowed into people on the side of the street  there was a mother and three children the children were killed on the spot it was mairead 's sister  instead of giving in to grief depression defeat in the face of that violence <unk> hooked up with betty a staunch protestant and a staunch catholic and they took to the streets to say no more violence  and they were able to get tens of thousands of primarily women some men in the streets to bring about change <unk>  and they have been part of what brought peace to northern ireland and they 're still working on it because there 's still a lot more to do  this is rigoberta <unk> menchu tum she also received the peace prize <unk> she is now running for president she is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy about how you bring democracy to the country about educating about how to vote but that democracy is not just about voting it 's about being an active citizen  one of the things that made this campaign work is because we grew from two ngos to thousands in ninety countries around the world working together in common cause to ban landmines <unk>  some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month they could maybe volunteer that much there were others like myself who were <unk> actions together of all of us that brought about that change  in my view what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace it 's not a dirty word <unk> it <unk> <unk> 's hard work every single day <unk> and if each of us who cares about the different things we care about <unk> time as we could <unk> we would change this world <unk> we would save this world and we can 't wait for the other guy we have to do it ourselves thank you
