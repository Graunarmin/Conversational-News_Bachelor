 <unk> this is going to be a motivational speech because imagine my motivation standing between this strong <unk> <unk> on twitter feel free to quote me if i say something memorable stupid funny whatever i love seeing my name on twitter <unk> so <unk> hi <unk> i 'm rick <unk>  i 'm a politician <unk>  i 'm sorry  how many in here have heard of the swedish pirate party before <unk> show of hands  ok that 's practically everybody probably due to the fact that we are sweden 's sweden 's neighbor <unk> i frequently ask how many have heard of any other political party and there 's always just scattered hands in the audience compared to this first question which is one half to two thirds this is actually the first time ever that does not match it was practically everybody so for those who haven 't heard of us <unk> the pirate party we love the net <unk>  we love copying and sharing <unk> and we love civil liberties  for that some people call us pirates <unk>  probably in an attempt to make us bow our heads and feel shame that didn 't work very well <unk> we decided to stand tall about it instead  and so in two thousand and six i founded a new political party <unk>  i led it for its first five years the european elections the last european elections we became the largest party and the the most coveted youth demographic sub 30 and what 's interesting is we did that on less than one percent of the competition 's budget <unk> we had a campaign budget total of fifty thousand euros they had six million between them <unk> beat them  that gave us a cost efficiency advantage of over two orders of magnitude <unk>  and i 'm gonna share the secret recipe of how we did that  we developed swarm methodologies <unk> and they can be applied to any business or social cause <unk>  well <unk> almost any there 's a small asterisk by the end <unk> and i 'll get to that in just a minute  but applying these and we 've done this dozens of times we know that this works <unk>  we 've put two people in the european parliament <unk> we have forty five people in various german state parliaments we 're in the <unk> czech senate many many many more local councils and as said we 've spread to seventy countries <unk> and that 's not bad for a political movement that hasn 't even been around for a decade so today we 're going to talk a bit about how people are motivated to be part of change to be part of something bigger than <unk> how you can channel this into an organization that harnesses this great power of wanting to make the world a better place <unk>  and in the end <unk> come out a little on the better when i speak to businesspeople <unk> i frequently make them very upset when i contradict them and say that no your employees are not your most valuable asset your most valuable asset is the thousands of people who want to work for you for free and you don 't let them  they get very upset about that  a swarm is a congregation of tens of thousands of volunteers that have chosen <unk> of their own will to converge on a common goal there 's this futurama quote  when push comes to shove <unk> you gotta do what you love even if it 's not a good idea i mean <unk> seriously what kind of idiot thinks they can change the world <unk> this kind of idiot apparently <unk> but it works <unk>  what you need to do is to put a stake in the ground you need to announce your goal just say i want to accomplish this  i 'm going to do this  and it doesn 't need to be very costly my announcement was just two lines in a chat channel <unk> hey look the pirate party has its website up now after new year 's and the address that was all the advertising i ever did the next time i had several hundred activists wanting to work with us  when you provide such a focus point a swarm intelligence emerges <unk> when people can rally to a <unk> and that 's what gives you this two orders of magnitude of cost efficiency  it 's a huge advantage you 're running circles around all the legacy organizations  and there are four goals that need to be fulfilled in your goal in order for this to work these four criteria are that your goal must <unk> let 's take a look at them it needs to be tangible a lot of people say well you know <unk> we should make the world a better place or  yeah <unk> we should all feel good now  not going to work <unk> you need a binary are we there yet <unk> or are <unk> not there yet it needs to be credible somebody seeing the project plan that you 're posting needs to see that yes this project plan will take us from where we are to where we want to be  you need to break it down into subgoals that each by themselves are seen as doable <unk> and when you add the subgoals together <unk> we 've gone to where we want it needs to be and this is where it gets exciting in terms of working <unk> anybody who sees this project plan needs to immediately say i want to do this and there 's my spot and they will be able to jump right into the project and start working on it without asking anybody 's permission <unk> and that is exactly what 'll happen  and last but not least it needs to be epic <unk> it needs to energize people it needs <unk> electrify people shoot for the moon  on second thought don 't shoot for the moon <unk> we 've already been there shoot for mars  in contrast <unk> you will never be able to get a volunteer swarm forming <unk> electrify people go to mars  a lot of people kind of balk at the obstacles we 're going to climb a huge mountain so how do you motivate people to do that well it turns out that obstacles are not the problem  not knowing the obstacles is the <unk> if you know how high the mountain is you know exactly what it takes to scale it we know exactly how far away mars is and what it takes to get there  if you can plan it like a project you can plan what resources you need and you can execute it exactly like a project let 's see we 're going to mars <unk> we need two dozen volunteer rocket scientists one dozen volunteer <unk> <unk> some crazy dude who will mix rocket fuel in his backyard and so on  when you can list the resources you know what you need to get there when you know what you need to get there  you can go there  and the next thing is to encourage this development of a swarm intelligence which is where the cost efficiency comes in <unk> there 's a ted talk on motivation that debunks that we work for money <unk>  and it presents science on how we 're really motivated by three things in terms of larger creative tasks when we work for something bigger than ourselves  we work for autonomy <unk> mastery and purpose we 've covered purpose already as in working for something bigger <unk> credible inclusive and epic so where <unk> that motivation talk ends what it doesn 't answer is how do you build an organization that harnesses this motivational power  and this is where working swarmwise comes in this is where swarm intelligence comes in turns out that there are three factors that you optimize for <unk> and each of these are in complete opposite to what you learn at a business school  but it works <unk> we know it works <unk> we have people in many many parliaments to prove it  those three factors are speed <unk> trust and scalability <unk> <unk> we optimize for speed by cutting bottlenecks out of the loop <unk> cutting them out of the decision loop <unk> that means cutting yourself out of the decision loop <unk>  which can be hard <unk>  but you 've got to communicate your vision so passionately so strongly that everybody knows what the goal is and can find something some step that takes the movement just a little closer to that goal <unk> and when tens of thousands <unk> of people do that on a weekly basis <unk> you become an unstoppable force <unk> we had a three person rule in our organization saying that if three self identified volunteers in the movement were in agreement that something was good for the movement they had the green light from the highest office to go ahead and act in the name of the <unk> including spending resources when you talk about this kind of empowerment to to traditional businesspeople <unk> they think you belong in a zoo <unk>  but you know what i led this organization for five years there were fifty thousand registered members and many many more anonymous activists <unk> it was not abused once  everybody had the key to the treasure chest <unk> it was not abused one single time turns out when you give people the keys to the castle and look them in the eye and say i trust you  they step up to the plate <unk> and that 's a beautiful thing to see happen <unk>  obviously not everything went according to plan but that 's a different thing we made mistakes <unk> we should expect mistakes if you 're pioneering something that means you must by definition venture into the unknown <unk> when you 're trying the unknown <unk> some things won 't go as planned that 's part of the definition of venturing into the unknown  to find the great you must allow mistakes to happen <unk> so you must communicate that we expect some things to go wrong to create a <unk> for iteration speed <unk>  meaning that we try <unk> we fail <unk> we try again we fail faster we fail better we try again we fail better again <unk>  maybe after we 've tried fifteen times we 've mastered some some specific subject so you want to minimize the time it takes to try those fifteen times  we optimize on trust we encourage <unk> you need to communicate your vision so strongly so that everybody can translate it into their own context because language is an incredibly strong <unk> advantage of working swarmwise  this leads to a lot of different approaches tried in parallel in different social groups who try out different methods of working toward the goal <unk>  some of them will work but in order to find the great ones <unk> you need this diversity <unk> and you need to communicate that we need that diversity <unk> if somebody on this <unk> side does not understand what those guys are doing <unk> that 's ok because we all trust each other to work for the better of the movement and it 's ok that i don 't understand their social context i 'm not expected to i understand my social context i contribute with something i know  make people aware of this diversity <unk> finally scalability get feet <unk> in business school they teach you to use a lean organization forget that  just scale up the organization from the get go start with ten thousand empty boxes and an org chart covering down to every minor city <unk> when you have lots and lots of small responsibilities in such a scaffolding that supports the swarm supports the activists you 'll find that <unk> boxes in the org charts are getting filled in quite rapidly and they start to get filled in beyond your horizon with people you 've never heard of  and so this swarm keeps growing keeps growing to tens of thousands of people each taking on something something small with very very decentralized mandate to act on the organization <unk> and this is when a swarm intelligence emerges <unk>  this is when you have this beehive logic where everybody knows what 's to be done everybody is taking their own small steps towards it  so the swarm starts to starts to act as a coherent organism <unk> and it 's amazing to watch <unk> this is when you 're awarded by the <unk> of magnitude two orders of magnitude <unk> this is not just a silver bullet  so we 've been talking a lot about the big picture today you can use these swarm methods for a lot of stuff do you want to change the world  do you want to bring clean water to a billion people teach three billion people to read <unk> maybe you 're into social change you want to introduce unconditional basic income or maybe you want to take humanity to mars <unk> you can do this using these methods  you can do this it 's about leadership it 's about deciding what you want to do and telling it to the world  because no matter whether you think you can or cannot change the world no matter whether you think you can or cannot change the world <unk> you are probably right <unk>  so one question i want everybody here to ask themselves today is the observation that change doesn 't just happen <unk> somebody makes it happen do you want to be that person  do you want to be that person <unk>  and then one <unk> one last thing  there 's one component more that 's required to work swarmwise that i haven 't mentioned yet <unk> and that is fun this goes beyond just enjoying your job <unk> this goes beyond having a pinball machine in the <unk> this is required to succeed to get that cost efficiency advantage of two orders of magnitude for the reason that you need to attract volunteers  and people in this aspect are rather predictable  people will go to other people who are having fun  in contrast <unk> they will walk an extra mile to avoid people who are not having fun  so  having fun is more than just having a pinball machine in the office <unk> it 's an absolute and unavoidable requirement for organizational and operational success when you 're working <unk> so in summary a recipe for a swarm organization using these motivational methods to a huge competitive advantage  your goal <unk> it needs to be tangible <unk> credible <unk> inclusive and epic <unk> your organization needs to be optimized for speed trust and scalability <unk>  you need to enjoy yourselves <unk> and that will reward you with two orders of magnitude of cost efficiency advantage thank you
