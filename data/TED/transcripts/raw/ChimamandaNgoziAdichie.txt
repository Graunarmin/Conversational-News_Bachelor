 <unk> so i would like to start by telling you about one of my greatest friends <unk> okoloma maduewesi  okoloma lived on my street and looked after me like a big brother <unk> if i liked a boy i would ask okoloma 's opinion <unk>  okoloma died in the notorious sosoliso plane crash in nigeria in december of two thousand and five <unk> almost exactly seven years ago <unk>  okoloma was a person i could argue with laugh with and truly talk to  he was also the first person to call me a feminist  i was about fourteen we were at his house arguing both of us bristling with half bit knowledge from books that we had read i don 't remember what this particular argument was about <unk>  but i remember that as i argued and argued okoloma looked at me and said you know you 're a feminist it was not a compliment  i could tell from his tone the same tone that you would use to say something like you 're a supporter of terrorism  i did not know exactly what this word <unk> meant <unk> and i did not want okoloma to know that i did not know  so i brushed it aside and i continued to argue and the first thing i planned to do when i got home was to look up the word feminist in the dictionary  now fast forward to some years later <unk> i wrote a novel about a man who among other things beats his wife and whose story doesn 't end very well while i was promoting the novel in nigeria a journalist <unk> a nice well meaning man <unk> told me he wanted to advise me  and for the nigerians here i 'm sure we 're all familiar with how quick our people are to give unsolicited advice  he told me that people were saying that my novel was feminist and his advice to me and he was shaking his head sadly as he spoke <unk> was that i should never call myself a feminist because feminists are women who are unhappy because they cannot find husbands  so i decided to call myself a happy feminist  then an academic a nigerian woman told me that feminism was not our culture and that feminism <unk> and that i was calling myself a feminist because i had been corrupted by western books  which amused me because a lot of my early readings were decidedly unfeminist i think i must have read every single mills & boon romance published before i was sixteen  and each time i tried to read those books called the feminist classics i 'd get bored <unk>  and i really struggled to finish them but anyway since feminism was un african i decided that i would now call myself a happy african feminist <unk> at some point i was a happy african feminist who does not hate men and who likes lip gloss and who wears high heels for herself but not for men  of course a lot of this was that word feminist is so heavy with baggage <unk> negative baggage <unk> you hate men <unk> you hate bras <unk> you hate african culture that sort of thing  now here 's a story from my childhood <unk> when i was in primary school my teacher said at the beginning of term that she would give the class a test and whoever got the highest score would be the class monitor <unk> now class monitor was a big deal <unk>  if you were a class monitor <unk> you got to write down the names of noisemakers  which was having enough power of <unk> my teacher would also give you a cane to hold in your hand while you walk around and patrol the class for noisemakers now of course you were not actually allowed to use the cane <unk>  but it was an exciting prospect for the nine year old me <unk> i very much wanted to be the class monitor <unk> and i got the highest score on the test  then to my surprise my teacher said that the monitor <unk> she had forgotten to make that clear earlier because she assumed it was obvious  a boy had the second highest score on the test and he would be monitor <unk> now what was even more interesting about this is that the boy was a sweet gentle soul who had no interest in patrolling the class with the cane <unk> male and so he became the class monitor <unk>  and i 've never forgotten that incident <unk>  i often make the mistake of thinking that something that is obvious to me is just as obvious to everyone else now take my dear friend louis for example  louis is a brilliant progressive man and we would have conversations and he would tell me i don 't know what you mean by things being different or harder for women  maybe in the past but not now and i didn 't understand how louis could not see what seems so <unk> self evident then one evening  in lagos louis and i went out with friends <unk> and for people here who are not familiar with lagos there 's that wonderful lagos ' fixture <unk>  the sprinkling of energetic men who hang around outside establishments and very dramatically <unk> you park your car i was impressed with the particular theatrics of the man who found us a parking spot that evening <unk> and so as we were leaving i decided to leave him a tip <unk>  i opened my bag <unk> put my hand inside my bag <unk> brought out my money that i had earned from doing my work and i gave it to the man  and he this man who was very <unk> why is he thanking me <unk> i didn 't give him the money then i saw realization dawn on louis ' face  the man believed that whatever money i had had ultimately <unk> come from louis because louis is a man men and women are different we have different hormones we have different sexual organs we have different biological abilities  women can have babies men can 't at least not yet  men have testosterone and are in general physically stronger than women there 's slightly more women than men in the world about fifty two percent of the world 's population is female but most of the positions of power and prestige are occupied by men <unk>  the late kenyan nobel peace laureate <unk> wangari maathai <unk> put it simply and well when she said  the higher you go the fewer women there are  in the recent us elections we kept hearing of the lilly ledbetter law <unk>  and if we go beyond the nicely alliterative name of that law <unk> it was really about a man and a woman doing the same job being equally qualified  and the man being paid more because he 's a man <unk>  so in the literal way men rule the world <unk> and this made sense a thousand years ago because human beings lived then in a world in which physical strength was the most important attribute for survival the physically <unk> person was more likely to lead and men in general are physically stronger of course there are many exceptions  but today we live in a vastly different world <unk>  the person more likely to lead is not the physically stronger person it is the more <unk> more intelligent person the more innovative person  and there are no hormones for those attributes a man is as likely as a woman to be intelligent to be creative to be innovative  we have evolved <unk> but it seems to me that our ideas of gender had not evolved <unk>  some weeks ago i walked into a lobby of one of the best nigerian hotels i thought about naming the hotel but i thought i probably shouldn 't and a guard at the entrance stopped me and asked me annoying questions because their automatic assumption is that a nigerian female walking into a hotel alone is a sex worker <unk>  and by the way why do these hotels focus on the ostensible supply rather than the demand for sex workers <unk> in lagos i cannot go alone into many reputable <unk> bars and clubs they just don 't let you in if you 're a woman alone you have to be accompanied by a man <unk>  each time i walk into a nigerian restaurant with a man <unk> the waiter greets the man and ignores me <unk>  the waiters are products  at this some women felt like yes i thought that the waiters are products of a society that has taught them that men are more important than women and i know that waiters don 't intend any harm <unk> but it 's one thing to know intellectually <unk> and quite another to feel it emotionally each time they ignore me i feel invisible <unk> i feel upset  i want to tell them that i am just as human as the man that i 'm just as worthy of acknowledgment <unk>  these are little things but sometimes it 's the little things that sting the most  and not long ago i wrote an article about what it means to be young and female in lagos and <unk> me it was so angry of course it was angry  i am angry <unk>  gender as it functions today is a grave injustice we should all be angry <unk> anger has a long history of bringing about positive change  but in <unk> addition to being angry i 'm also hopeful because i believe deeply in the ability of human beings to make and remake themselves for the better  gender matters everywhere in the world <unk> but i want to focus on nigeria and on africa in general because it is where i know and because it is where my heart is <unk> and i would like today to ask that we begin to dream about and plan for a different world a <unk> a world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves <unk> and this is how to start we must raise our daughters differently <unk>  we must also raise our sons differently <unk>  we do a great disservice to boys on how we raise them we stifle the humanity of boys  we define masculinity in a very narrow way <unk> masculinity becomes this hard small cage and we put boys inside the cage <unk> teach boys to be afraid of fear <unk> we teach boys to be afraid of weakness of vulnerability <unk>  we teach them to mask their true selves because they have to be <unk> in nigerian speak hard man  in secondary school <unk> a boy and a girl <unk> both of them teenagers <unk> both of them with the same amount of pocket money  would go out and then the boy would be expected always <unk> to pay to prove his masculinity and yet we wonder why boys are more likely to steal money from their parents  what if both boys and girls were raised not to link masculinity with money  what if the attitude was not the boy has to pay but rather whoever has more should pay  now of course because of that historical advantage <unk> it is mostly men who will have more today but if we start raising children differently <unk>  then in fifty years in a hundred years boys will no longer have the pressure of having to prove this masculinity  but by far the worst thing we do to males by making them feel that they have to be hard is that we leave them with very <unk> man feels compelled to be the weaker his ego is  and then we do a much greater disservice to girls because we raise them to cater to the fragile egos of men <unk>  we teach girls to shrink themselves to make themselves smaller we say to girls you can have ambition but not too much <unk> you should aim to be successful <unk> but not too successful otherwise you would threaten the man  if you are the breadwinner in your relationship with a man <unk> you have to pretend that you 're not especially in public <unk>  otherwise you will emasculate him <unk>  but what if we question the premise itself why should a woman 's success be a threat to a man <unk> what if we decide simply dispose of that word and i don 't think there 's an english word i dislike more than emasculation  a nigerian acquaintance once asked me if i was worried that men would be intimidated by me <unk>  i was not worried at all in fact it had not occurred to me to be worried because a man who would be intimidated by me is exactly the kind of man i would have no interest in <unk> i was really struck by this  because i 'm female i 'm expected to aspire to marriage <unk>  i 'm expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important <unk>  a marriage can be a good thing <unk> it can be a source of joy and love and <unk> but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don 't teach boys the same  i know a woman who decided to sell her house because she didn 't want to intimidate a man who might marry her  i know an unmarried woman in nigeria who when she goes to conferences wears a wedding ring because according to her she wants the other participants in the conference to give her <unk> i know young women who are under so much pressure from family from friends even from work to get married <unk> and they 're pushed to make terrible choices  a woman at a certain age who is unmarried our society teaches her to see it as a deep personal failure  and a man at a certain age who is unmarried <unk> we just think he hasn 't come around to making his pick <unk> it 's easy for us to say oh but women can just say no to all of this but the reality is more difficult and more complex  we 're all social beings we internalize ideas from our socialization even the language we use in talking about marriage and relationships illustrates this  <unk> the language of marriage is often the language of ownership rather than the language of partnership <unk>  <unk> to mean something a woman shows a man but often not something a man shows a woman  both men and women in nigeria will say this is an expression i 'm very amused by i did it for peace in my marriage  now when men say it it is usually about something that they should not be doing anyway  laughter sometimes they say it to their friends it 's something to say to their friends in a kind of fondly exasperated way <unk> something that ultimately proves how masculine they are how needed how loved oh my wife said i can 't go to the club every night so for peace in my marriage i do it only on weekends  now when a woman says i did it for peace in my marriage she 's usually talking about giving up a job a dream <unk> we teach females that in relationships compromise is what women do  we raise girls to see each other as competitors not for jobs or for accomplishments which i think can be a good thing <unk> but for attention of men <unk>  we teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are if we have sons we don 't mind knowing about our sons <unk> but of course when the time is right we expect those girls to bring back the perfect man to be their husbands <unk>  we police girls we praise girls for virginity <unk> but we don 't praise boys for virginity and it 's always made me wonder how exactly this is supposed to <unk> the loss of virginity is usually a process that involves <unk>  recently a young woman was gang raped in a university in nigeria i think some of us know about that and the response of many young nigerians both male and female was something along the lines of this  yes rape is wrong <unk>  <unk> doing in a room with four boys  now if we can forget the horrible inhumanity of that response  these nigerians have been raised to think of women as inherently guilty  and they have been raised to expect so little of men that the idea of men as savage beings without any control is somehow acceptable <unk> we teach girls shame <unk> we make them feel as though by being born female they 're already guilty of something  and so girls grow up to be women who cannot see they have desire they grow up to be women who silence themselves  they grow up to be women who cannot say what they truly think and they grow up and this is the worst thing we did to girls they grow up to be women who have turned pretense into an art form i know a woman who hates domestic work  she just hates it but she pretends that she likes it  because she 's been taught that to be good wife material she has to be to use that nigerian word very homely <unk> and then she got married <unk> and after a while her husband 's family began to complain that she had changed  actually she had not changed she just got tired of pretending <unk> the problem with gender is that it prescribes how we should be rather than recognizing how we are now imagine how much happier we would be how much freer to be our true individual selves <unk> if we didn 't have the weight of gender expectations boys and girls are undeniably different biologically but socialization exaggerates the differences and then it becomes a self fulfilling process <unk> now take cooking for example  today women in general are more likely to do the housework than men <unk> the cooking and cleaning <unk> but why is that is it because women are born with a cooking gene <unk> or because over years they have been socialized to see cooking as their role <unk>  actually i was going to say that maybe women are born with a cooking gene <unk> until i remember that the majority of the famous cooks in the world whom we give the fancy title of chefs are men <unk>  i used to look up to my grandmother who was a brilliant brilliant woman and wonder how she would have been if she had the same opportunities as men when she was growing up now today there are many more opportunities for women <unk> than there were during my grandmother 's time because of changes in policy changes in law <unk> all of which are very important but what matters even more is our attitude  our mindset what we believe and what we value about gender  what if in raising children we focus on ability instead of gender what if in raising <unk> children we focus on interest instead of gender <unk>  i know a family who have a son and a daughter both of whom are brilliant at school who are wonderful lovely children when the boy is hungry the parents say to the girl go and cook indomie noodles for your brother now  the daughter doesn 't particularly like to cook indomie noodles but she 's <unk> and so she has to now what if the parents from the beginning taught both the boy and the girl to cook indomie cooking by the way is a very useful skill for boys to have i 've never never thought it made sense to leave such a crucial thing the ability to nourish oneself has the same degree and the same job as her husband when they get back from work <unk> she does most of the housework <unk> which i think is true for many marriages <unk> but what struck me about them was that whenever her husband changed the baby 's diaper she said thank you to him <unk> now what if she saw this as perfectly normal and natural that he should in fact <unk> care for his child i 'm trying to unlearn many of the lessons of gender that i internalized when i was growing up <unk> but i sometimes still feel very vulnerable in the face of gender expectations  the first time i taught a writing class in graduate school <unk>  i was worried i wasn 't worried about the material i would teach because <unk> and i was going to teach what i enjoy teaching instead i was worried about what to wear  i wanted to be taken seriously <unk>  i knew that because i was female i will automatically have to prove my worth <unk>  and i was worried that if i looked too feminine i would not be taken seriously <unk> i really wanted to wear my shiny lip gloss and my girly skirt <unk>  but i decided not to  <unk> i wore a very serious very manly and very ugly suit  because the sad truth is that when it comes to appearance we start off with men as the standard as the norm <unk>  if a man is getting ready for a business meeting he doesn 't worry about looking too masculine and therefore not being taken for granted <unk>  if a woman has to get ready for business meeting she has to worry about looking too feminine and what it says and whether or not she will be taken i wish i had not worn that ugly suit that day i 've actually banished it from my closet by the way had i then the confidence that i have now to be myself my students would have benefited even more from my teaching <unk> because i would have been more comfortable and more fully and more truly myself <unk>  i have chosen to no longer be apologetic for my <unk> for my femininity  and i want to be respected in all of my femaleness because i deserve to be  gender is not an easy conversation to have  for both men and women to bring up gender is sometimes to encounter almost immediate resistance i can imagine some people here are actually thinking women too do sef  some of the men here might be thinking ok all of this is interesting but i don 't think like that  and that is part of the problem that many men do not actively think about gender or notice gender is part of the problem of gender that <unk> like my friend louis that everything is fine now  and that many men do nothing to change it <unk> if you are a man and you walk into a restaurant with a woman and the waiter greets only you  does it occur to you to ask the waiter why haven 't you greeted her <unk> we may repose part of a longer version of this talk so because gender can be a very uncomfortable conversation to have there are very easy ways to close it to close the conversation so some people will bring up evolutionary biology and apes how you know female apes bow down to <unk> apes also live on trees and have earthworms for breakfast <unk> and we don 't <unk> some people will say well poor men also have a hard time and this is true <unk>  <unk> but this is not what this conversation is about  gender and class are different forms of oppression i actually learned quite a bit about systems of oppression and how they can be blind to one another by talking to black men  i was once talking to a black man about gender and he said to me why do you have to <unk> experience as a woman ' why can 't it be ' your experience as a human being '  now this was the same man who would often talk about his experience as a black man <unk>  gender matters men and women experience the world differently <unk>  gender colors the way we experience the world <unk> but we can change that  some people will say oh but women have the real power <unk> bottom power non nigerians bottom power is an expression which i suppose means something like a woman who uses her sexuality to get favors from men  but bottom power is not power at all  bottom power means that a woman simply has a good root to tap into from time to time somebody else 's <unk> and then of course we have to wonder what happens when that somebody else is in a bad mood or sick or impotent  some people will say that a woman being subordinate to a man is our culture <unk>  but culture is constantly changing i have beautiful twin nieces who are fifteen and live <unk> if they had been born a hundred years ago they would have been taken away and killed because it was our culture <unk> it was our culture to kill twins so what is the point of culture i mean there 's the decorative the dancing but also culture really is about preservation and continuity of a people  in my family i am the child who is most interested in the story of who we are in our traditions in the knowledge about ancestral lands my brothers are <unk> as interested as i am but i cannot participate <unk> i cannot go to umunna meetings i cannot have a say because i 'm female  culture does not make people people make culture  so if it is in fact true  so if it is in fact true that the full humanity of women is not our culture <unk> we must make it our culture <unk> i think very often of my dear friend okoloma maduewesi may he and all the others who passed away in that sosoliso crash continue to rest in peace  he will always be remembered by those of us who loved him  and he was right that day many years ago when he called me a feminist i am <unk> feminist  and when i looked up the word in the dictionary that day this is what it said feminist <unk> a person who believes in the social political and economic equality of the sexes  my great grandmother from the stories i 've heard was a feminist <unk>  she ran away from the house of the man she did not want to marry and ended up marrying the man of her choice <unk> she refused she protested <unk> spoke up whenever she felt she was being deprived of access of land that sort of thing my great grandmother did not know that word feminist  but it doesn 't mean that she wasn 't one  more of us should reclaim that word  my own definition of feminist is a feminist is a man or a woman who says a feminist is a man or a woman who says  yes there 's a problem with gender as it is today and we must fix it we must do better  best feminist i know is my
