 <unk> good evening my journey to this stage began when i came to america at the age of seventeen  you see i 'm one of the eighty four million americans who are immigrants or children of immigrants <unk> each of us has a dream when we come here a dream that usually has to be rewritten and always has to be repurposed  i was one of the lucky ones my revised dream led me to the work i do today <unk> training immigrants to run for public office and leading a movement for inclusive democracy <unk> but i don 't want you to think it was a cakewalk that america opened its arms wide and welcomed me it 's still not doing that  and i 've learned a few lessons along the way that i wanted to share with you because i think that together we can make american democracy better and stronger <unk>  i was born in india <unk> the world 's largest democracy <unk> and when i was four my family moved to belize <unk> the world 's smallest democracy perhaps <unk>  and at the age of seventeen <unk> i moved to the united states <unk> the world 's greatest democracy  i came because i wanted to study english literature  you see as a child <unk> i buried my nose in books <unk> and i thought why not make a living doing that as an adult  but after i graduated from college and got a graduate degree i found myself moving from one less ideal job to another <unk>  maybe it was the optimism that i had about america that made me take a while to understand that things were not going to change the door that i thought was open was actually just slightly ajar this door of america that would open wide if you had the right <unk> name the right skin color <unk> the right networks <unk> but could just slam in your face if you had the wrong religion the wrong immigration status <unk> the wrong skin color <unk>  and i just couldn 't accept that so i started a career as a <unk> starting an organization for young people like myself i was young at the time that i started it who traced their heritage to the indian subcontinent  in that work i became and advocate for south asians and other immigrants <unk> i lobbied members of congress on policy issues  i volunteered on election day to do exit polling <unk>  but i couldn 't vote <unk> and i couldn 't run for office so in two thousand when it was announced that the citizenship application fee was going to more than double from ninety five dollars to two hundred and twenty five dollars i decided it was time to apply before i could no longer afford it i filled out a long application answering questions about my current and my past affiliations <unk> and once the application <unk> was submitted <unk> there were fingerprints to be taken a test to study for endless hours of waiting in line  you might call it extreme vetting  and then in december of two thousand i joined hundreds of other immigrants in a hall in brooklyn where we pledged our loyalty to a country that we had long <unk> long considered home my journey from international student to american citizen took sixteen years a short timeline when you compare it to other immigrant stories <unk> and soon after i had taken that formal step to becoming an american the attacks of september eleven two thousand and one changed the immigration landscape for decades to come my city new york city was reeling and healing and in the midst of it we were in an election cycle  two things happened as we coped with loss and recovery in new york city  voters elected michael bloomberg mayor of new york city <unk>  we also adopted by ballot referendum <unk> office of immigrant affairs for the city of new york five months after that election <unk> the newly elected mayor appointed me the first commissioner of immigrant affairs for this newly established office <unk>  i want you to come back to that time i was a young immigrant woman from belize i had basically floundered in various jobs <unk> in america before i started a community based organization in a church basement in queens <unk>  the attacks of september eleven sent shock waves through my community  people who were members of my family  young people i had worked with were experiencing harassment at schools at workplaces and in airports <unk>  <unk> i was going to represent their concerns in government  no job felt more perfect for me and here are two things i learned when i became commissioner  first new yorkers who were in city government holding government positions had no idea how scared immigrants were of <unk> law enforcement most of us don 't really know the difference do we between a sheriff and local police and the fbi <unk>  and most of us when we see someone in uniform going through our neighborhoods feel curiosity if not concern <unk>  so if you 're an undocumented parent every day when you say goodbye to your child <unk> send them off to school and go to work you don 't know what the chances are that you 're going to see them at the end of the day because a raid at your workplace  a chance encounter with local police could change the course of your life forever <unk>  the second thing i learned is that when people like me who understood that fear <unk> who had learned a new language who had navigated new systems when people like us were sitting at the table <unk>  we advocated for our communities ' needs in a way that no one else could or would <unk> i understood what that feeling of fear was like  people in my family were experiencing it young people i had worked with were being harassed not just by classmates <unk> but also by their teachers  my husband then boyfriend thought twice <unk> before he put a backpack on or grew a beard because he traveled so much  what i learned in two thousand and one was that my vote mattered but that my voice and vantage point also mattered <unk>  and it 's these three things immigrants ' votes <unk> voices and vantage points that i think can help make our democracy stronger we actually have the power to change the outcome of elections to introduce new issues into the policy debate and to change the face of the pale <unk> male stale leadership that we have in our country today <unk> so how do we do that <unk> let 's talk first about votes it will come as no surprise to you that the majority of voters in america are white <unk>  but it might surprise you to know that one in three voters are black latino or asian but here 's the thing it doesn 't just matter who can vote it matters who does vote  so in two thousand and twelve half of the latino and asian american <unk> and these votes matter not just in presidential elections <unk> they matter in local and state elections in two thousand and fifteen lan diep <unk> the eldest son of political refugees from vietnam <unk>  ran for a seat in the san jose city council  he lost that election by thirteen votes <unk> he dusted off those campaign shoes and went back to run for that seat and this time he won by twelve votes <unk> every one of our votes matters <unk>  and when people like lan are sitting at the policy table <unk> they can make a difference we need those voices we need those voices in part because american leadership does not <unk> look like america 's residents <unk> there are over five hundred thousand local and state offices in america  fewer than two percent of those offices are held by asian americans or latinos the two largest immigrant groups in our country  in the city of yakima washington <unk> of the population is latino there has never been a latino on the city council until this year <unk> three newly elected latinas joined the yakima city council in two thousand and sixteen one of them is carmen <unk> mndez  she is a first generation college student she grew up partly in colima mexico  and partly in yakima washington she 's a single mother a community advocate  her voice on the yakima city <unk> council is advocating on behalf of the latino community and of all yakima residents <unk> and she 's a role model for her daughter and other latinas <unk>  but the third most untapped resource in american democracy is the vantage point that immigrants bring we have fought to be here <unk> we have come for economic and educational opportunity <unk> we have come for political and religious freedom <unk> we have come in the pursuit of love  that dedication that commitment to america we also bring to public service people like athena salman who just last week won the primary for a seat in the arizona state house athena 's father grew up in the west bank and moved to chicago <unk> where he met her mother  her mother is part italian part mexican and part german together they moved to arizona and built a life <unk>  athena when she gets to the statehouse is going to fight for things like education funding that will help give families like hers a leg up so they can achieve the financial stability that we all <unk> looking for  immigrants ' votes voices and vantage points are what we all need to work to include in american democracy it 's not just my work it 's also yours <unk>  and it 's not going to be easy <unk> we never know what putting a new factor into an equation will <unk> and it 's a little scary you 're scared that i 'm going to take away your place at the table <unk> and i 'm scared that i 'm never going to get a place at the table  and we 're all scared that we 're going to lose this country that we know and love <unk>  i 'm scared you 're going to take it away from me and you 're scared i 'm going to take it away from you  look it 's been a rough election year <unk> reminder that people with my immigration history could be removed at the whim of a leader <unk> but i have fought to be in this country and i continue to do so every day  so my optimism never wavers  because i know that there are millions of immigrants just like me in front of me <unk> behind me and all around me  it 's our country
