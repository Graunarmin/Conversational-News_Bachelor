 <unk> talking about designing humor which is sort of an interesting thing but it goes to some of the discussions about constraints and how in certain contexts humor is right and in other contexts it 's wrong <unk> now i 'm from new york so it 's one hundred percent satisfaction actually that 's ridiculous because when it comes to humor seventy five percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for nobody is ever satisfied one hundred percent with humor except this woman <unk> that part of the relationship went fine  laughter now let 's look at this <unk> things i 'm pointing out is that cartoons appear within the context of the new yorker magazine that lovely caslon type and it seems like a fairly benign cartoon within this context <unk> <unk> it 's making a little bit fun of getting older and you know people might like it but like i said you cannot satisfy everyone you couldn 't satisfy this guy  yorker is rather a sensitive environment very easy for people to get their nose out of joint and one of the things that you realize is it 's an unusual environment <unk> here i 'm one person talking to you you 're all collective <unk> you all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh in the new yorker it goes out to a wide audience and when you actually look <unk> that and nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor is really interesting let 's look at this cartoon  discouraging data on the antidepressant  indeed it is discouraging now <unk> you would think well look most <unk> was funny in general that seems like a funny cartoon but let 's look what online survey i did  generally about <unk> eighty five percent of the people liked it a hundred and nine voted it a ten the highest ten voted it one <unk> but look at the individual responses  i like animals look how much they like them  i don 't want to hurt them that doesn 't seem very funny to me <unk> to people like this i point out we use anesthetic ink  other people thought it was funny that actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor when you don 't have the contagion of humor <unk>  humor is a type of entertainment  all entertainment contains a little frisson of danger something that might happen wrong and yet we like it when there 's protection <unk> 's what a zoo is it 's danger the tiger is there the bars protect us <unk> that 's sort of fun right <unk> that 's a bad zoo it 's a very politically correct zoo <unk> but it 's a bad zoo but this is a worse one  so in dealing with humor in the context of the new yorker <unk> you have to see where is that tiger going to be where is the danger going to exist how are you going to manage it <unk>  my job is to look at one thousand cartoons a week <unk> but the new yorker only can take sixteen or seventeen cartoons <unk>  and we have one thousand cartoons of course many many cartoons must be rejected now we could fit more cartoons in the magazine if we removed the articles i feel that would be a huge loss <unk>  one i could live with but still huge  cartoonists come in through the magazine every week the average cartoonist who stays with the magazine does ten or fifteen ideas every week <unk> but they mostly are going to be rejected that 's the nature of any creative activity many of them fade away  some of them stay matt diffee is one of them here 's one of his cartoons  drew dernavich accounting night at the improv now is the part of the show when we ask the audience to shout out some random numbers <unk> i know all about rejection because when i quit actually i was booted out of psychology school and decided to become a cartoonist a natural segue  from one thousand nine hundred and seventy four to one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven i submitted two thousand cartoons to the new yorker and got two thousand cartoons rejected by the new yorker at a certain point <unk> this rejection slip <unk> i broke into the new yorker and started selling cartoons finally in one thousand nine hundred and eighty i received the revered new yorker contract which i blurred out parts because it 's none of your business <unk> idea drawings <unk> nowhere in the contract is the word cartoon mentioned  the word idea drawings and that <unk> that 's the sine qua non of new yorker cartoons <unk> so what is an idea drawing an idea drawing is something that requires you to think now that 's not a cartoon <unk> it requires thinking on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part to make it into a cartoon <unk> you get my cast of cartoon mind there is no justice in the world there is some justice in the world the world is just  this is what lemmings believe <unk> new yorker and i when we made comments <unk> the cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is what is it the cartoon is it really about lemmings no it 's about us <unk>  you know it 's my view basically about religion that the the real conflict and all the fights between religion is who <unk> and this is my most well known cartoon no thursday 's out how about never is never good for you it 's been reprinted thousands of times totally ripped off <unk> it 's even on thongs <unk> but compressed to how about never is never good for you  now these look like very different forms of humor but actually they bear a great <unk> similarity <unk> in each instance our expectations are defied <unk>  in each instance <unk> the narrative gets switched there 's an incongruity and a contrast in no thursday 's out how about never is never good for you what you have is the syntax of politeness and the message of being rude <unk>  that really is how <unk> humor works it 's a cognitive synergy where we mash up these two things which don 't go together and temporarily in our minds exist he is both being polite and rude <unk>  in here <unk> you have the propriety of the new yorker and the vulgarity of the language basically that 's the way humor works so i 'm a humor analyst you would say now <unk> e b white said analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog nobody is much interested and the frog dies <unk>  <unk> there won 't be any genocide but really it makes me let 's look at this picture this is an interesting picture <unk> the laughing audience there are the people fops up there but everybody is laughing everybody is laughing except one guy <unk>  this guy <unk> who is he he 's the critic  he 's the critic of humor <unk> and really i 'm forced to be in that <unk> position when i 'm at the new yorker and that 's the danger that i will become this guy <unk> now here 's a little video made by matt diffee <unk> sort of how they imagine if we really exaggerated that <unk> many cartoons so many that there are many books called the rejection collection the rejection collection is not quite new yorker kind of humor and you might notice the bum on the sidewalk here who is boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking see that 's probably not going to be new yorker humor  it 's actually put together by matt diffee one of our cartoonists <unk> you have an interesting the guilty laugh the laugh against your better judgment <unk> cartoons you never saw and never will see in the new yorker this humor is perfect i 'm going to explain why there 's a concept about humor about it being a benign violation  in other words for something to be funny we 've got to think it 's both wrong and also okay at the same time <unk> if we think it 's completely wrong we say that 's not <unk> if it 's completely okay what 's the joke <unk> okay <unk> and so this benign <unk> that 's true of no thursday 's out how about never is never good for you it 's rude the world really shouldn 't be <unk> <unk> that way within that context <unk> we feel it 's okay <unk> so within this context  <unk> the violation <unk> it doesn 't work there is no such thing as funny in and of itself <unk> everything will be within the context and our expectations  one way to look at it is this it 's sort of called a meta motivational theory about how we look a theory about motivation and the mood we 're in and how the mood we 're in determines the things we like or dislike  when we 're in a playful mood we want excitement <unk> we want high arousal <unk> feel excited then if we 're in a purposeful mood that makes us anxious  the rejection collection is absolutely in this field you want to be stimulated you want to be aroused you want to be transgressed it 's like this like an amusement <unk> is both in danger and safe <unk> incredibly aroused there 's no joke no joke needed <unk> if you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough they will laugh at very very little  this is another cartoon from the rejection collection <unk> cartoon about terrorism the new yorker occupies a very different space it 's a space that is playful in its own way and also purposeful and in that space <unk>  the cartoons are different  now i 'm going to show you cartoons the new yorker did right after nine eleven a very very sensitive area when humor could be used how would the new yorker attack it it would not be with a guy with a or there was another cartoon i didn 't show because actually i thought maybe people would be offended <unk>  the great sam gross cartoon <unk> this happened after the muhammad controversy where it 's muhammad in heaven the suicide bomber is all in little pieces and he 's saying to the suicide bomber you 'll get the <unk> better left undrawn  the first week we did no cartoons  that was a black hole for humor and correctly so it 's not always appropriate every time <unk> but the next week this was the first cartoon i thought i 'd never laugh again then i saw your jacket  it basically was about if we were alive we were going to laugh we were going to breathe we were going to exist here 's another one i figure if i don 't have that third martini then the terrorists win  these cartoons are not about them they 're about us  the humor reflects back on us the easiest thing to do with humor <unk> and it 's perfectly legitimate is a friend makes fun of an enemy <unk> it 's called dispositional humor <unk> it 's ninety five percent of the humor <unk> it 's not our humor here 's another cartoon i wouldn 't mind living in a fundamentalist islamic state <unk> target is us the target is the readership and the people who do it the humor is self reflective and makes us think about our assumptions  look at this cartoon by roz chast the guy reading the obituary two years younger than you twelve years older than you <unk> three years your junior  your age on the dot exactly your age  <unk> a deeply profound cartoon <unk>  and so the new yorker is also trying to in some way make cartoons say something besides funny and something about us here 's another one i started my vegetarianism for health reasons <unk> then it became a moral choice and now it 's just to annoy people  excuse me i think there 's something wrong with this in a tiny way that no <unk> one other than me would ever be able to pinpoint  so it focuses on our obsessions our narcissism our foils and our foibles really not someone else 's the new yorker demands some cognitive work on your part and what it demands is what arthur koestler who wrote the act of creation about the relationship between humor and science is what 's called bisociation you have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference <unk> and you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon <unk> if <unk> <unk> the different frames of reference don 't come together in about 5 seconds it 's not funny but i think they will for you here different frames of reference  <unk> and this is einstein in bed to you it was fast <unk> now there are some cartoons that are puzzling like this cartoon would puzzle many people  how many people know what this cartoon means  the dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk this is the signal for a <unk> that 's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year called i don 't get it the new yorker cartoon i q test  the other thing the new yorker plays around with is incongruity and incongruity i 've shown you is sort of the basis of humor <unk> something that 's completely normal or logical isn 't going to be funny <unk>  but the way incongruity works is observational humor is humor within the realm of reality my boss is always telling me what to do okay <unk> that could happen it 's humor within the realm of reality <unk> here <unk> cowboy to a cow very impressive i 'd like to find five thousand more like you  we understand that it 's absurd but we 're putting the two together <unk> here in the nonsense range  damn it hopkins didn 't you get yesterday 's memo <unk> now that 's a little puzzling right it doesn 't quite come together  in general people who enjoy more nonsense enjoy more abstract art  they tend to be liberal less conservative that type of stuff <unk> but for us and for me helping design the humor it doesn 't make any sense to compare one to the other it 's sort of a smorgasbord that 's made <unk> so i want to sum all this up with a caption to a cartoon and i think this sums up the whole thing really about the new yorker cartoons it sort of makes you stop and think doesn 't it and now when you look at new yorker cartoons i 'd like you to stop and think a little bit more about
