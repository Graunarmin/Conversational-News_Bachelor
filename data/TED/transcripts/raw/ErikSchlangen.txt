 <unk> ha <unk> you probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road it 's made of asphalt <unk> and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on <unk> but not always <unk> especially not on these days as today when it 's raining a lot  then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt <unk> and especially if you then ride with your bicycle <unk> and pass these cars <unk> then that 's not very nice  also asphalt can create a lot of noise it 's a noisy material <unk>  and if we produce roads like in the netherlands very close to cities then we would like a silent road  the solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt <unk> porous asphalt a material that we use now in most of the highways in the netherlands <unk>  it has pores and water can just rain through it  so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides <unk> and you have a road that 's easy to drive on <unk> so no splash water anymore  also the noise will disappear in these pores because it 's very hollow all the noise will disappear so it 's a very silent road  <unk> has disadvantages of course <unk> and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur what is raveling you see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off <unk> first you get one stone <unk>  then several more and more and more and more and more and then they <unk> not happy with that <unk> and finally this raveling can also lead to more and more damage <unk> sometimes you can create potholes with that ha he 's ready <unk>  potholes of course that can become a problem but we have a solution here you see actually how the damage appears <unk> in this material it 's a porous asphalt like i said so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones  due to weathering <unk> due to u v light due to oxidation  this binder this bitumen the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink <unk>  and if it shrinks it gets micro cracks and it delaminates from the aggregates <unk> then if you drive over the road you take out the aggregates what we just saw here  to solve this <unk> if we can make this material self healing  then probably we have a solution <unk>  so what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans <unk>  and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen <unk>  so then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it  <unk> then you need a machine like you see here that you can use for cooking an induction machine  induction can heat especially steel it 's very good at that  then what you do is you heat up the steel you melt the bitumen <unk> and the bitumen will flow into these micro cracks and the stones are again fixed to the surface  today i use a microwave because i cannot take the big induction <unk> microwave is a similar system <unk> so i put the specimen in <unk> which i 'm now going to take out to see what happened <unk>  so this is the specimen coming out now <unk> so i said we have we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the the specimens we tested a lot of specimens there <unk> and then the government they actually saw our <unk> that 's very interesting we have to try that so they donated to us a piece of highway four hundred meters of the <unk> <unk> had to make a test track to test this material <unk> so that 's what we did here you see where we were making the test road  and then of course this road will last several years without any damage that 's what we know from practice <unk>  so we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab so we did aging on the samples did a lot of loading on it healed them with our induction machine <unk> and healed them and tested them again several times we can repeat that <unk>  so actually the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine this is the big version we have made to go on the real road if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road which of course saves a lot of money well to conclude i can say that we made a material using steel fibers the addition of steel fibers <unk> using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road double the surface life you can even do so it will <unk> really save a lot of money with very simple tricks
