 <unk> so for any of us in this room today let 's start out by admitting we 're lucky <unk>  we don 't live in the world our mothers lived in our grandmothers lived in where career choices for women were so limited <unk>  and if you 're in <unk> room today most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights and amazingly <unk> we still live in a world where some women don 't have them <unk>  but all that aside <unk> we still have a problem and it 's a real problem <unk> and the problem is this  women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world <unk>  the numbers tell the story quite clearly one hundred <unk> and ninety heads of state nine are women  of all the people in parliament in the world <unk> thirteen percent are women  in the corporate sector women at the top c level jobs board seats tops out at fifteen sixteen percent the numbers have not moved since two thousand and two and are going in the wrong direction and even in the non profit world a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women women at the top twenty percent <unk> we also have another problem <unk> which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment a recent study in the u s showed that <unk> of married senior managers two thirds of the married men had children and only one third of the married women had children a couple of years ago i <unk> in new york and i was pitching a deal <unk> and i was in one of those fancy new york private equity offices you can picture <unk>  and i 'm in the meeting it 's about a three hour meeting and two hours in there needs to be that bio break and everyone stands up <unk>  and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed <unk> and i realized he doesn 't know where the women 's room is in his office  so i start looking around for moving boxes figuring they just moved in but i don 't see any and so i said did you just move into this <unk> office and he said no we 've been here about a year and i said are you telling me that i am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year  and he looked at me and he said yeah <unk> or maybe you 're the only one who had to go to the bathroom  so the question is how are we going to fix this how do we change <unk> these numbers at the top <unk> how do we make this different <unk> i want to start out by saying i talk about this about keeping women in the workforce because i really think that 's the answer  in the high income part of our workforce in the people who end up at the top fortune five hundred ceo jobs or the equivalent in other industries the problem i am convinced is that women are dropping <unk> out <unk> now people talk about this a lot and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women i want to talk about none of that today even though that 's all really important  today i want to focus on what we can do as individuals <unk>  what are the messages we need to tell ourselves what are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us what are the messages we tell our daughters  now at the outset <unk> want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments i don 't have the right answer i don 't even have it for myself <unk> i left san francisco where i live on monday and i was getting on the plane for this conference and my daughter who 's three when i dropped her off at preschool did that whole hugging the leg crying mommy don 't get on the plane thing  <unk> i feel guilty sometimes <unk> i know no women <unk>  whether they 're at home or whether they 're in the workforce who don 't feel that sometimes so i 'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone my talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce <unk> and i think there are three  one <unk> sit at the table two make your partner a real partner <unk> don 't leave before you leave <unk>  number one sit at the table just a couple weeks ago at facebook we hosted a very senior government official and he came in to meet with senior execs from around silicon valley <unk>  and everyone kind of sat at the table he had these two women who were traveling with him pretty senior in his department <unk> and i kind of said to them <unk> sit at the table and they sat on the side of the room  when i was in college my senior year i took a course called european intellectual history don 't you love that kind of thing from college i wish i could do that now <unk> and i took it with my roommate carrie who was then a brilliant literary student and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar and my brother smart guy but a <unk> <unk> the three of us take this class together <unk>  and then carrie reads all the books in the original greek and latin goes to all the lectures <unk>  i read all the books in english and go to most of the lectures <unk> my brother is kind of busy <unk> he reads one book of twelve and goes to a couple of lectures <unk> marches <unk> <unk> himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored <unk>  <unk> three of us go to the exam together <unk> and we sit down <unk> and we sit there for three hours and our little blue notebooks <unk> <unk> we walk out we look at each other and we say how did you do  and carrie says boy i feel like i didn 't really draw out the main point on the hegelian dialectic  and i say god i really wish i had really connected john locke 's theory of property with the philosophers that follow  and my brother says i got the top grade in the class <unk> you got the top grade in the class you don 't know anything  the problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows  women systematically underestimate their own abilities if you test men and women and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like gpas men get it wrong slightly high and women get it wrong slightly low  women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce a study in the last two years <unk> of people entering the workforce out of college showed that fifty seven percent of boys entering or men i guess  are negotiating their first salary and only seven percent of women <unk> and most importantly  men attribute their success to themselves and women attribute it to other external factors <unk> if you ask men why they did a good job they 'll say obviously why are you even asking if you ask women why they did a good job what they 'll say is someone helped them they got lucky they worked really hard <unk>  why does this matter <unk> boy it matters a lot <unk> because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side not at the table <unk> and no one gets the promotion if they don 't think they deserve their success or they don 't even understand their own success <unk>  i wish the answer were easy <unk> i wish i could go tell all the young women i work for these fabulous women believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself own your own success  i wish i could tell that to my daughter but it 's not that simple because what the data shows above all else is one thing <unk>  which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated <unk> for women <unk> and everyone 's nodding because we all know this to be true <unk>  there 's a really good study that shows this really well <unk> there 's a famous harvard business school study on a woman named heidi roizen <unk>  and she 's an operator in a company in silicon valley <unk> and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture <unk> in two thousand and two not so long ago a professor who was then at columbia university took that case and made it [ howard ] roizen <unk>  and he gave the case out both of them to two groups of students <unk> he changed exactly one word  heidi to howard but that one word made a really big difference <unk>  he then surveyed the students <unk> and the good news was the students both men and women <unk> thought heidi and howard were equally competent and that 's good  the bad news was that everyone <unk> liked howard he 's a great guy you want to work for him you want to spend the day fishing with him but heidi  not so sure she 's a little out for herself she 's a little political you 're not sure you 'd want to work for her  this is the complication we have to tell our daughters and our colleagues we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the a to reach for the <unk> to sit at the table <unk> and we have to do it in a world where for them there are sacrifices they will make for that even though for their brothers there are not  the saddest thing about all of this is that it 's really hard to remember this and i 'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me but i think important <unk>  i gave this talk at facebook not so long ago to about one hundred employees and a couple hours later there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk <unk> she wanted to talk to me <unk> i said okay and she sat down and we talked and she said i learned something today i learned that i need to keep my hand up  what do you mean she said you 're giving this talk and you said you would take two more questions <unk> i had my hand up with many other people and you took two more questions i put my hand down <unk> and i noticed all the women did the same and then you <unk> only from the men  and i thought to myself wow <unk> if it 's me who cares about this obviously giving this talk and during this talk i can 't even notice that the men 's hands are still raised and the women 's hands are still raised <unk> how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women we 've got to get women to sit at the table number two  make your partner a real partner i 've become convinced that we 've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home the data shows this very clearly <unk> if a woman and a man work full time and have a child <unk> the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does <unk> and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does so she 's got three jobs or two jobs and he 's got one who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more  the causes of this are really complicated and i don 't have time to go into them and i don 't think sunday football watching and general laziness is the cause <unk>  i think the cause is more complicated <unk> i think as a society <unk> we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls <unk>  i know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers and it 's hard <unk>  when i go to the mommy and me stuff and i see the father there i notice that the other mommies don 't play with him <unk>  and that 's a problem <unk> because we have to make it as important a job because it 's the hardest job in the world <unk> studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate <unk> and if that wasn 't good enough motivation for everyone out there they also have more how shall i say this on this stage they know each other more in the biblical sense as well  message number three don 't leave before you leave i think there 's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking and i see this all the time with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving  here 's what happens we 're all busy everyone 's busy a woman 's busy <unk> and she starts thinking about having a child  and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child she starts thinking about making room for that child how am i going to fit <unk> this into everything else i 'm doing and literally from that moment  she doesn 't raise her hand anymore <unk> she doesn 't look for a promotion she doesn 't take on the new project she doesn 't say me i want to do that she starts leaning back <unk>  the problem is that let 's say she got pregnant that day that day nine months of pregnancy three months of maternity leave six months to catch your breath <unk> years more often and as i 've seen it women start thinking about this way earlier when they get engaged or married when they start thinking about having a child which can take a long time  one woman came to see me about this she looked a little young and i said so are you and your husband thinking about having a baby and she said oh no i 'm not married she <unk> you 're thinking about this just way too early but the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back <unk>  everyone who 's been through this and i 'm here to tell you once you have a child at home your job better be really good to go back because it 's hard to leave that kid at home  your job needs to be challenging it needs to be rewarding <unk> you need to feel like you 're making a difference <unk>  and if two years ago you didn 't take a promotion and some guy next to you did  if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities you 're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal  don 't leave before you leave stay in keep your foot on the gas pedal until the very day you need to <unk> to take a break for a child and then make your decisions don 't make decisions too far in advance <unk> particularly ones you 're not even conscious you 're making  my generation really sadly is not going to change the numbers at the top they 're just not moving we are not going to get to where fifty percent of the population in my generation there will not be fifty percent of [ women ] at the top of any industry <unk> but i 'm hopeful that future generations can i think a <unk> world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women <unk> would be a better world <unk> it 's not just because people would know where the women 's bathrooms are even though that would be very helpful <unk> i think it would be a better world <unk>  i have two children i have a five year old son and a two year old daughter <unk>  i want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home  and i want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed but to be liked for her accomplishments <unk> thank you
