 <unk> to you lexicography the practice of compiling dictionaries <unk> notice we 're very specific that word <unk> dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite out of a lump of rock it 's made up of lots of little bits it 's little discrete that 's spelled <unk> bits <unk>  and those bits are words <unk> now one of the perks of being a lexicographer besides getting to come to ted is that you get to say really fun <unk> lexicographical has this great pattern it 's called a double dactyl and just by saying double dactyl i 've sent the geek needle all the way into the red but  lexicographical is the same pattern as higgledy piggledy right it 's a fun word to say and i get to say it a lot  now one of the non perks of being a lexicographer is that people don 't usually have a kind of warm fuzzy snuggly <unk> what people really often think about the dictionary is they think more like this  just to let you know i do not have a lexicographical whistle but people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left hand turn into the dictionary <unk>  and keep the bad words out <unk>  but the thing is i don 't want to be a traffic cop for one thing i just do not do uniforms and for another <unk> deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy <unk> and it 's not very fun <unk>  and when parts of your job are not easy or fun you kind of look for an excuse not to do them <unk>  so if i had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work i would much rather be a <unk> i want to throw my big net into the deep blue ocean of english and see what marvelous creatures i can drag up from the bottom  but why do people want me to direct traffic when i would much rather go fishing <unk> well <unk> i blame the queen <unk> why do i blame the queen well first of all i blame the queen because it 's funny but secondly <unk> i blame the queen because dictionaries have really not changed our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign  the only thing that queen victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the f word which has happened in american dictionaries since <unk> so there 's this guy right victorian era james murray <unk> first editor of the oxford english dictionary <unk> i do not have that hat <unk> i wish i had that hat <unk>  so he 's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today when a guy who looks like that in that hat <unk> is the face of modernity you have a problem <unk>  and so <unk> james murray could get a job on any dictionary today <unk>  there 'd be virtually no learning curve and of course a few of us are saying okay computers computers what about computers the thing about computers is <unk> i love computers <unk> i mean i 'm a huge geek i love computers <unk> i would go on a hunger strike before i let them take away google book search from me <unk> computers don 't do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries <unk> they don 't change the end result <unk>  because what a dictionary is is it 's victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion <unk> it 's steampunk what we have is an electric velocipede <unk> we have victorian design with an engine on it that 's all the design has not changed <unk>  and ok what about online dictionaries right online dictionaries must be different  this is the oxford english dictionary online one of the best online dictionaries this is my favorite word by the way erinaceous  pertaining to the hedgehog family of the nature of a hedgehog very useful word  so look at that online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen <unk> is flat look how many links there are in the actual entry two right  those little buttons i had them all expanded except for the date chart so there 's not very much going on here there 's not a lot of clickiness  and in fact online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print <unk> except for searchability <unk>  and when you improve searchability you actually take away the one advantage of print which is serendipity serendipity is when you <unk> things you weren 't looking for because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult so  now when you think about this what we have here is a ham butt problem <unk> does everyone know the ham butt problem <unk> woman 's making a ham for a big family dinner she <unk> goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away and she looks at this piece of ham and she 's like this is a perfectly good piece of ham why am i throwing this away she thought well  my mom always did this so she calls up mom and she says mom why 'd you cut the butt off the ham when you 're making a ham she says i don 't know my mom always did it so they call grandma <unk> and grandma says my pan was too small  so <unk> it 's not that we have good words and bad words <unk> we have a pan that 's too small you know that ham butt is delicious there 's no reason to throw it away the bad words <unk> see when people think about a place and they don 't find a place on the map <unk> they think this map sucks  when they find a nightspot or a bar and it 's not in the guidebook they 're like ooh this place must be cool it 's not in the guidebook  when they find a word that 's not in the dictionary they think this must be a bad word  why it 's more likely to be a bad dictionary why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan  <unk> you can 't get a smaller ham the english language is as big as it is so if you have a ham butt problem and you 're thinking about the ham butt problem <unk>  the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive  paper is the enemy of words <unk>  how can this be i mean i love books <unk> i really love books some of my best <unk> there will still be paper dictionaries <unk> when we had cars when cars became the dominant mode of transportation we didn 't round up all the horses and shoot them you know there 're still going to be paper dictionaries but it 's not going to be the dominant <unk> dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in and it 's not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in so think about it this way <unk>  if you 've got an artificial constraint artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview  what if biologists could only study animals that <unk> what if we made aesthetic judgments about animals and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study  we 'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna <unk> and not very much about much else <unk> and i think this is a problem i think we should study all the words because when you think about words <unk> you can make beautiful expressions <unk> from very humble parts <unk> lexicography is really more about material science we are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression your speeches and your writing <unk>  and then often people say to me well <unk> ok <unk> how do i know that this word is real  <unk> if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers <unk>  how can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball peen hammer  they 're just the right tools for the job and so people say to me how do i know if a word is real you know anybody who 's read a children 's book knows that love makes things real <unk> if you love a word <unk> use it that makes it real  being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction it doesn 't make a word any more real than <unk> any other way <unk>  if you love a word <unk> it becomes real <unk>  so if we 're not worrying about directing traffic <unk> if we 've transcended paper  if we are worrying less about control and more about description then we can think of the english language as being this beautiful mobile  and any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes is touched any time you touch a word <unk> you use it in a new context you give it a new connotation you verb it  you make the mobile move <unk> you didn 't break it it 's just in a new position and that new position can be just as beautiful now <unk> if you 're no longer a traffic cop the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection or the cars get confused <unk> right <unk> but if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic but maybe to count the cars that go by  then more eyeballs are better <unk> you can ask for help <unk> if you ask for help <unk>  you get more done <unk> and we really need help <unk> library of congress <unk> million books of which half are in english if only one out of every ten of those books had a word that 's not in the dictionary in it  that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries <unk> and i find an <unk> point one million newspaper pages <unk> if only one in one hundred of those pages had an un dictionaried word on it it would be an entire other <unk> that 's five hundred thousand more words <unk> so that 's a lot and i 'm not even talking about <unk> talking about blogs and i find more new words on boingboing in a given week than i do newsweek or time  there 's a lot going on there and i 'm not even talking about polysemy <unk> which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves so if you think of the word set a set can be a badger 's burrow a set can be one of the pleats in an elizabethan ruff <unk> and there 's one numbered definition in the <unk> little word thirty three numbered definitions one of them is just labeled miscellaneous technical senses  do you know what that says to me that says to me it was friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub  that 's a lexicographical cop out to say miscellaneous technical senses so we have <unk> words and we really need help <unk> and the thing is we could ask for help asking for help 's not that hard <unk> i mean <unk> lexicography is not rocket science see <unk> i just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers <unk> and this is more of a visual explanation if we think of the dictionary as being the map of the english language  these bright spots are what we know about and the dark spots are where we are in the dark if that was the map of all the words in american english  we don 't know very <unk> and we don 't even know the shape of the language  if this was the dictionary if this was the map of american english look we have a kind of lumpy idea of florida <unk> but there 's no california we 're missing california from american english we just don 't know enough <unk> and we don 't even know that we 're missing california we don 't even see <unk> that there 's a gap on the map so again lexicography is not rocket science <unk> but even if it were rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs <unk> these days you know  it can 't be that hard to find some words <unk>  so <unk> enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help and they 're doing a good job of it  for instance there 's ebird where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings and then ornithologists can go and help track <unk> and there 's this guy mike oates mike oates lives in the u k he 's a director of an electroplating company he 's found more than one hundred and forty comets  he 's found so many comets they named a comet after him <unk> it 's kind of out past mars it 's a hike i don 't think he 's getting his picture taken there anytime soon <unk> but he found one hundred and forty comets without a telescope <unk>  he downloaded data from the nasa soho satellite and that 's how he found them if we can find comets without a telescope shouldn 't we be able to find words <unk>  now y 'all know where i 'm going with this because i 'm going to the internet which is where everybody goes and the internet is great for collecting words because the internet 's full of collectors <unk>  and this is a little known technological fact about the internet but the internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm  and words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography so there are a lot of really good word collecting sites out there right now but the problem with some of them is that they 're not scientific enough they show the word but they don 't show any context where did it come from who said it  what newspaper was it in what book because a word is like an an archaeological artifact <unk> if you don 't know the provenance or the source of the artifact <unk> it 's not science <unk> it 's a pretty thing to look at  so a word without its source is like a cut flower <unk> you know it 's pretty to look at for a while but then it dies it dies too fast <unk>  so <unk>  this whole time i 've been saying the dictionary the dictionary the dictionary the dictionary not a dictionary or dictionaries and that 's because well people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language they use it synecdochically <unk>  and one of the problems of knowing a word like synecdochically is that you really want an excuse <unk> this whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where i could say synecdochically to all of you so i 'm really sorry <unk> but when you use a part of something like the dictionary is a part of the language or a flag stands for the united states it 's a symbol of the country then you 're using it synecdochically <unk> but the thing is we could make the dictionary the whole language <unk> if we get a bigger <unk> pan then we can put all the words in we can put in all the meanings doesn 't everyone want more meaning in their lives  and we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language we can make it be the whole language <unk> we can put in all the
