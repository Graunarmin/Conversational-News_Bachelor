 <unk> friend 's house and she had on her shelf a copy of the dsm manual <unk> which is the manual of mental disorders it lists every known mental <unk> and it used to be back in the ' 50s a very slim pamphlet and then it got bigger and bigger and bigger and now it 's eight hundred and eighty six pages long and it lists currently three hundred and seventy four mental disorders <unk> so i was leafing through it wondering if i had any mental disorders and it turns out i 've got twelve i 've got generalized anxiety disorder <unk> which is a <unk> i 've got nightmare disorder <unk> which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure <unk> and all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going <unk> malingering and generalized anxiety disorder because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious <unk> anyway i was looking through this book wondering if i was much crazier than i thought i was <unk> or maybe it 's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you 're not a trained professional  <unk> disorder i didn 't know which of these was true but i thought it was kind of interesting and i thought maybe i should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view <unk> which is how i ended up having lunch with the scientologists  it was a man called brian who runs a crack team of scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies they 're called the cchr <unk>  and i said to him <unk> prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo science that can 't be trusted <unk> it 's where they send the serial killers and the people who can 't help themselves and i said to brian well what did tony do and he said <unk> hardly anything he beat someone up or something <unk> and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence <unk> but he faked <unk> now he 's stuck in broadmoor and nobody will believe he 's sane do you want us to try and get you into broadmoor to meet tony so i said yes please  so i got the train to broadmoor i began to yawn uncontrollably around kempton park  which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious they yawn uncontrollably <unk> center <unk> which is where you get to meet the patients <unk> it looks like a giant hampton inn <unk> it 's all peach and pine and calming colors and the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons and the patients started drifting in and they were quite <unk> the worst evil in the world but i 'm thinking it 's probably a good idea  and then brian said here 's tony and a man was walking in and he wasn 't overweight he was in very good physical <unk> he was wearing a pinstripe suit and he had his arm outstretched like someone out of the apprentice he looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane <unk>  and he sat down and i said so is it true that you faked your way in here  and he said yep yep absolutely i beat someone up when i was seventeen and i was in prison awaiting trial and my cellmate said to me ' you know what you have to do <unk> fake madness  tell them you 're mad you 'll get sent to some cushy hospital <unk> nurses will bring you pizzas you 'll have your own playstation ' i said well how did you do it he said well i asked to see the prison psychiatrist and i 'd just seen a film called ' crash ' in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls <unk> a biography of ted bundy that they had at the prison library anyway he faked madness too well <unk> he said and they didn 't send him to some cushy hospital and the minute he got there said he took one look at the place asked to see the psychiatrist said there 's been a terrible misunderstanding <unk> i 'm not mentally ill  i said how long have you been here for  he said well if i 'd just done my time in prison for the original crime i 'd have got five years <unk>  i 've been in broadmoor for twelve years  tony said that it 's a lot harder to convince people you 're sane than it is to convince them you 're crazy he said  i thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or what 's on tv <unk>  i subscribe to new scientist and recently they had an article about how the u s army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives <unk> did you know that the u s army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives ' when i read my medical notes i saw they 'd written ' believes bees can sniff out explosives ' he said  you know they 're always looking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state <unk> but how do you sit in a sane way how do you cross your legs in a sane way it 's just impossible when tony said that to me i thought to myself am i sitting like a journalist am i crossing my legs like a journalist he said <unk> you know <unk> i 've got the stockwell strangler on one side of me <unk>  and i 've got the ' tiptoe through the tulips ' rapist on the other side of me <unk> so i tend to stay in my room a lot because i find them quite frightening <unk> and they take that as a sign of madness <unk> they say it proves that i 'm aloof <unk> only in broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness anyway he seemed completely normal to me but what did i know  and when i got home i emailed his clinician anthony maden i said what 's the story  and he said yep we accept that tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence because his hallucinations that had seemed quite cliche to begin with just <unk> vanished the minute he got to broadmoor however <unk> we have assessed him and we 've determined that what he is is a psychopath  and in fact faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath it 's on the checklist cunning manipulative  so faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong <unk> and i spoke to other experts and they said the pinstripe suit classic psychopath speaks to items one and two on <unk> the checklist <unk> glibness superficial charm and grandiose sense of self worth and i said well but why didn 't he hang out with the the other patients classic psychopath it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy so all the things that had seemed most normal about tony was evidence according to his clinician that he was mad in this new way <unk> he was a psychopath <unk> and his clinician said to me if you want to know more <unk> about psychopaths you can go on a course run by robert hare who invented the psychopath checklist so i did i went on a <unk> psychopath spotting course and i am now a certified and i have to say extremely adept psychopath spotter  <unk> 's the statistics one in a hundred regular people is a psychopath so there 's one thousand five hundred people in his room <unk> fifteen of you are psychopaths <unk>  although that figure rises to four percent of ceos and business leaders so i think there 's a very good chance there 's about thirty or forty psychopaths in this room <unk> be carnage by the end of the night  laughter hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior the lack of empathy the glibness <unk> cunning <unk> in fact capitalism perhaps at its most remorseless is a physical manifestation of psychopathy it 's like a form of psychopathy that 's come down to affect us all hare said you know what forget about some guy at broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness who cares that 's not a big story the big story he said is corporate psychopathy you want to go and interview yourself <unk> so i gave it a try i wrote to the enron people i said could i come and interview you in prison to find out it you 're psychopaths and they didn 't reply  so i changed tack i emailed chainsaw al dunlap the asset stripper from the <unk> he would come into failing businesses and close down thirty percent of the workforce just turn american towns into <unk> ghost towns and i emailed him and i said i believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you special and interested in the predatory spirit and fearless can i come and interview you about your special brain anomaly and he said come on over  so i went to al dunlap 's grand <unk> 've got sharks and he was saying this in a less effeminate way you 've got more sharks and you 've got tigers it was like narnia  and then we went into his kitchen now al dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies he 'd close down thirty percent of the workforce and he 'd quite often fire people with a joke like for instance one famous story about him somebody came up to him and said i 've just bought myself a new car and he said <unk> well you may have a new car but i 'll tell you what you don 't have <unk> so in his kitchen he was in there with his wife judy and his bodyguard sean and i said you know how i said in my email that you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special he said yeah it 's an amazing theory it 's like star trek you 're going where no man has gone before and i said <unk> i 've got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket can i go through them with you and he looked intrigued despite himself and he said okay go on and i said okay <unk>  grandiose sense of self worth which i have to say would have been <unk> who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions <unk> going down the psychopath checklist basically turning it into who moved my cheese  but i did notice something happening to me the day i was with al dunlap whenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal like <unk> <unk> he said no to juvenile delinquency he said he got accepted into west point <unk> and <unk> 's only ever been married twice admittedly his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument and his second marriage has lasted forty one years <unk> so whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of <unk> <unk> i thought to myself well i 'm not going to put that in my book <unk> and then i realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned me a little bit psychopathic because i was desperate to shove him in a box marked psychopath i was desperate to define him by his maddest edges and i realized my god this is what i 've been doing for twenty years it 's what all journalists do we travel across the world with our notepads <unk> we wait for the gems <unk> and the gems are always the outermost aspects of our interviewee 's personality and we stitch them together like medieval monks and we leave the normal stuff on the floor <unk> and you know this is a country that <unk> certain mental disorders hugely childhood bipolar children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums <unk> which scores them high on the bipolar checklist <unk> when i got back to london tony phoned me he said why haven 't you been returning my calls <unk> say you feel remorse for your crime they say ' typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn 't ' it 's like witchcraft <unk> they turn everything <unk> <unk> i 've got a tribunal coming up will you come to it  so i said okay <unk> so i went to his tribunal and after fourteen years in broadmoor they let him go <unk> decided that he shouldn 't be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism so they let him go and outside in the corridor he said to me you know what jon everyone 's a bit psychopathic <unk> to go to belgium there 's a woman there that i fancy but she 's married so i 'm going to have to get her split up from her husband  anyway that was two years ago and that 's where my book ended and for the last twenty <unk> everything was fine nothing bad happened he was living with a girl outside london <unk> he was according to brian the scientologist making up for lost time <unk>  which i know sounds ominous but isn 't necessarily ominous <unk>  unfortunately after twenty months he did go back to jail for a month he got into a fracas in a bar he called it ended up going to jail for a month which i know is bad but at least a month implies that <unk> 't too bad <unk> and then he phoned me <unk> and you know what i think it 's right that tony is out because you shouldn 't define people by their maddest edges and what tony is is he 's <unk> he 's a gray area in a world that <unk> the gray areas are where you find the complexity it 's where you find the humanity and it 's where you find the truth  and tony said to me jon <unk> could i buy you a drink in a bar i just want to thank you for everything you 've done for me and i didn 't go what would <unk> you have done thank you
