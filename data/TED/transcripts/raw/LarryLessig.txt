 <unk> a place called lesterland <unk>  now lesterland looks a lot like the united states  like the united states it has about three hundred and eleven million people and of that three hundred and eleven million people it turns out hundred and forty four thousand are called lester <unk>  if matt 's in the audience i just borrowed that i 'll return it in a second this character from your from your series so one hundred and forty four thousand are called lester which means about <unk> <unk> percent is named lester now lesters in lesterland have this extraordinary power there are two elections every election cycle in lesterland one is called the election <unk> the other is called the lester election <unk>  and in the general election it 's the citizens who get to vote but in the lester election it 's the lesters who get to vote and here 's the trick in order to run in the general election <unk>  you must do extremely well in the lester election you don 't necessarily have to win but you must do extremely well now <unk> what can we say about democracy <unk> in lesterland  what we can say number one as the supreme court said in citizens united that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials <unk> because after all there is a general election <unk>  but only after the lesters have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in the general election and number two <unk> obviously this dependence upon the lesters is going to produce a subtle <unk> we could say camouflaged bending to keep the lesters happy <unk>  okay <unk> so we have a democracy <unk> no doubt  but it 's dependent upon the lesters and dependent upon the people it has competing dependencies we could say conflicting dependencies depending upon who the <unk> now there are three things i want you to see now that i 've described lesterland number one the united states is lesterland the united states is lesterland the united states also looks like this also has two elections one we called the general election the second we should call the money election <unk>  in the general election it 's the citizens who get to vote if you 're over eighteen in some states if you have an id in the money election it 's the funders who get to vote the <unk> who get to vote and just like in lesterland the trick is to run in the general election you must do extremely well in the money election you don 't necessarily have to win there is jerry brown but you must do <unk> extremely well <unk> and here 's the key <unk> there are just as few relevant funders in <unk> as there are <unk> the numbers from two thousand and ten 26 percent of america gave two hundred dollars or more to any federal candidate 05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate 01 percent the one percent of the one percent gave ten thousand dollars or more to federal <unk> gave sixty percent of the super pac money spent in the cycle we have just seen ending <unk>  so i 'm just a lawyer i look at this range of numbers and i say it 's fair for me to say it 's <unk> <unk> percent who are our relevant funders in america <unk> in this sense the funders are our lesters now what can we say about this democracy in usa land well as the supreme court said in citizens united we could say of course the people have the ultimate influence over the elected officials we have a general election <unk>  but only after the funders have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in that general election <unk> this dependence upon the funders produces a subtle <unk> understated camouflaged bending to keep the funders happy <unk>  candidates for congress and members of congress spend between thirty and seventy percent of their time raising money to get back to congress or to get their party back into power <unk>  and the question we need to ask is what does it do to them these humans as they spend their time behind the telephone <unk> calling people they 've never met but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent as anyone would as they do this they develop a sixth sense <unk>  a constant awareness about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money they become in the words of the <unk> as they constantly adjust their views in light of what they know will help them to raise money not on issues one to ten <unk> eleven to one thousand leslie byrne a democrat from virginia describes that when she went to congress she was told by a colleague always lean to the green  then to clarify she went on he was not an environmentalist  so here too we have a democracy a democracy dependent upon the funders and dependent upon the people competing dependencies  possibly conflicting <unk> dependencies depending upon who the funders are okay <unk> the united states is lesterland <unk> point number one here 's point number two the united states is worse than lesterland <unk>  worse than lesterland because you can imagine in lesterland if we lesters got a letter from the government that said hey you get to pick who gets to run in the <unk> we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of lesters you know there are lesters from every part of social society there are rich lesters poor lesters black lesters white lesters  not many women lesters but put that to the side for one second we have lesters from everywhere we could think what could we do to make lesterland better it 's at least possible the lesters would act for the good of lesterland <unk>  but in our land <unk> in this land  <unk> there are certainly some sweet lesters out there many of them in this room here today but the vast majority of lesters act for the lesters <unk>  because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the 05 percent are not comprising it for the public interest it 's for their private interest in this sense the usa is worse than lesterland and finally point number three  whatever one wants to say about lesterland against the background of its history its traditions in our land in lesterland is a corruption a corruption  now by corruption i don 't mean brown paper bag cash secreted among members of congress i don 't mean rod blagojevich sense of corruption i don 't mean any criminal act the corruption i 'm talking about is perfectly legal <unk>  it 's a corruption relative to the framers ' baseline for this republic the framers gave <unk> us what they called a republic <unk>  but by a republic they meant a representative democracy <unk>  and by a representative democracy they meant a government as madison put it in federalist fifty two that would have a branch that would be dependent upon the people alone  so here 's the model of government they have the people and the government with this exclusive dependency <unk> but the problem here is that congress has evolved a different dependence no longer a dependence upon the people alone increasingly a dependence upon the funders <unk> now this is a dependence too <unk>  but it 's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone so long as the funders are not the people this is <unk> there 's good news and bad news about this corruption one bit of good news is that it 's bipartisan equal opportunity corruption <unk>  it blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about it blocks the right too as it makes principled arguments of the right increasingly <unk> impossible <unk> so the right wants smaller government when al gore was vice president his team had an idea for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry the chief policy man took <unk> this idea to capitol hill <unk> and as he reported back to me the response was hell no if we deregulate these guys <unk> how are we going to raise money from them  this is a system that 's designed to save the status quo including the status quo of big and invasive government it works against the left and the right and that you might say is good news but here 's the bad news <unk>  <unk> pathological <unk> corruption <unk>  because in any system where the members are dependent upon the tiniest fraction of us for their election that means the tiniest number of us <unk> the tiniest tiniest number of us can block reform <unk> i know that should have been like a rock or something i can only find cheese i 'm sorry so there <unk> there is an economy here an economy of influence an economy with lobbyists at the center which feeds on polarization  it feeds on dysfunction the worse that it is for us <unk>  the better that it is for this fundraising  henry david thoreau there are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root <unk> this is the root <unk> okay <unk> now <unk> every single one of you knows this  you couldn 't be here if you didn 't know this yet you ignore it you ignore it  this is an impossible problem you focus on the possible problems <unk> like eradicating polio from <unk> the world or taking an image of every single street across the globe or building the first real universal translator or building a fusion factory in your <unk> <unk> garage these are the manageable problems so you ignore  so you ignore this corruption <unk> but we cannot ignore this <unk> a government that works  and not works for the left or the right but works for the left and the right the citizens of the left and right because there is no sensible reform <unk> possible until we end this corruption <unk> so i want you to take hold to grab the issue you care the most about climate change is mine but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax <unk> system or inequality grab that issue sit it down in front of you look straight in its eyes and tell it there is no christmas this year <unk> there will never be a christmas we will never <unk> get your issue solved until we fix this issue first so it 's not that mine is the most important issue it 's not  <unk> but mine is the first issue the issue we have to solve before we get to fix the issues you care about no sensible reform and we cannot afford a world <unk> a future with no sensible reform <unk> okay <unk> so how do we do it  turns out the analytics here are easy simple  if the problem is members spending an extraordinary amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of america <unk> the solution is to have them spend less <unk> time fundraising but fundraise from a wider slice of americans to spread it out to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea of dependence upon the people alone <unk>  and to do this does not require a constitutional amendment changing the first amendment to do this would require a single statute <unk>  a statute establishing what we think of as small dollar funded elections <unk> a statute of citizen funded campaigns and there 's any number of these proposals out there fair elections now act <unk> the american <unk> <unk> act an idea in my book that i call the grant and franklin project to give vouchers to people to fund elections an idea of john sarbanes called the grassroots democracy act each of these would fix this corruption <unk> by spreading out the influence of funders to all of us the analytics are easy here it 's the politics that 's hard <unk>  indeed impossibly hard <unk> because this reform would <unk> shrink k street <unk> and capitol hill <unk>  as congressman jim cooper <unk> a democrat from tennessee put it has become a farm league for k street a farm league for k street members and staffers and bureaucrats have an increasingly common business model in their head a business model focused on their life after government their life as lobbyists <unk>  fifty percent of the senate between one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and two thousand and four left to become lobbyists forty two percent of the house those numbers have only gone up <unk> and as united republic calculated last april the average increase in salary for those who they tracked was one thousand four hundred and <unk> percent <unk> so it 's fair to ask how is it possible for them to change this now i get this skepticism <unk> i get this cynicism i get this sense of impossibility  but i don 't buy it  this is a solvable issue if you think about the issues our parents tried to solve in the 20th century  issues like racism or sexism or the issue that we 've been fighting in this century <unk> homophobia <unk> those are hard issues  you don 't wake up one day no longer a racist it takes generations to tear that intuition that dna out of the soul of a people <unk> but this is a problem of just incentives just incentives change the incentives and the behavior changes and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems have seen overnight a change in the practice when connecticut adopted this system in the very first year seventy eight percent of elected representatives gave up large contributions and took <unk> it 's solvable  not by being a democrat not by being a republican it 's solvable by being citizens by being citizens by being tedizens <unk> because if you want to kickstart reform <unk> look i could kickstart reform at half the price of fixing energy policy i could give you back a republic even if you 're not yet with me <unk>  even if you believe this is impossible <unk>  what the five years since i spoke at ted has taught me as i 've spoken about this issue again and again is even if you think it 's impossible that is irrelevant  i spoke at dartmouth once and a woman stood up after i spoke i write in my book and she said to me <unk> convinced me this is hopeless hopeless there 's nothing we can do  when she said that i scrambled i tried to think how do i respond to that hopelessness what is that sense of hopelessness and what hit me was an image of my six year old son  and i imagined a doctor coming to me and <unk> your son has terminal brain cancer <unk> and there 's nothing you can do  nothing you can do so would i do nothing would i just sit there accept it okay nothing i can do i 'm going off to build google glass  of course not i would do everything i could and i would do everything i could because this is what love means  that the odds are irrelevant and that you do <unk> the hell you can the odds be damned and then i saw the obvious link because even we liberals love this country  and so when the pundits and the politicians say that change is impossible <unk> what this love of country says back is everyone in this room loves and cherishes if we lose this republic and so we act with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong <unk> so here 's my question  do you have that love do you <unk> have that love because if you do <unk> then what the hell are you what are the hell are we doing <unk>  when ben franklin was carried from the constitutional convention in september of one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven he was stopped in the street by a woman who said mr franklin what have you wrought  franklin said a republic madam if you can keep it <unk> a representative democracy a government dependent upon the people alone <unk>  we have lost that republic all of us have to act to get it back
