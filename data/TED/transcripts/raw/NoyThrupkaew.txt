 <unk> ten years ago i went through a little bit of a hard time  so i decided to go see a therapist i had been seeing her for a few months when she looked at me one day and said who actually raised you until you were three <unk> i don 't think that 's actually the case because if it were we 'd be dealing with things that are far more complicated than just this it sounded like the setup to a joke <unk> but i knew she was serious <unk>  because when i first started seeing her i was trying to be the funniest person in the room <unk> and i would try and crack these jokes but she caught on to me really quickly <unk>  and whenever i tried to make a joke she would look at me and say that is actually really sad <unk> so i knew i had to be serious <unk> and i asked my parents who had actually raised me until i was three <unk> and to my surprise they said my primary caregiver had been a distant relative of the family <unk> i had called her my auntie <unk> i remember my auntie so <unk> clearly it felt like she had been part of my life when i was much older <unk>  i remember the thick straight hair and how it would come around me like a curtain when she bent to pick me up  her soft southern thai accent <unk> the way i would cling to her even if she just wanted to go to the bathroom or get something to eat  i loved her but [ with ] the ferocity that a child has sometimes before she understands that love <unk> also requires letting go <unk>  but my clearest and sharpest memory of my auntie is also one of my first memories of life at all <unk>  i remember her being beaten and slapped by another member of my family <unk>  i remember screaming hysterically and wanting it to stop as i did every single time it happened for things as minor as wanting to go out with her <unk> friends or being a little late <unk>  i became so hysterical over her treatment that eventually she was just beaten behind closed doors  things got so bad for her that eventually she ran away <unk>  as an adult i learned later that she had been just nineteen when she was brought over from thailand to the states to care for me on a tourist visa <unk> she wound up working in illinois for a time before eventually returning to thailand which is where i ran into her again at a political rally in bangkok <unk>  i clung to her again as i had when i was a child <unk> and i let go and then i promised that i would call <unk>  i never did <unk> though <unk> because i was afraid if i said everything that she meant to me that i owed perhaps the best parts of who i became to her care  and that the words i 'm sorry were like a thimble to bail out all the guilt and shame and rage i felt over everything she had endured to care for me for as long as she had i thought if i said those words to her i would never stop crying again <unk> had saved me and i had not saved her <unk>  i 'm a journalist and i 've been writing and researching human trafficking for the past eight years or so <unk>  and even so i never put together this personal story with my professional life until pretty <unk> i think this profound disconnect actually symbolizes most of our understanding about human trafficking <unk>  because human trafficking is far more prevalent complex and close to home than most of us realize <unk>  i spent time in jails and brothels <unk> interviewed hundreds of survivors and law enforcement ngo workers <unk> and when i think about what we 've done about human trafficking <unk> partly because we don 't even talk about the problem right at all  when i say human trafficking most of you probably don 't think about someone like my auntie  you probably think about a young girl or woman who 's been brutally forced into prostitution by a violent pimp <unk>  that is real suffering <unk> and that is a real story that story makes me angry for far more than just the reality of that situation as a journalist i really care about how we relate to each other through language and the way we tell that story with all the gory violent detail the salacious aspects i call that look at her scars journalism  we use that story to convince ourselves that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl that story lets us off the hook it takes away all the societal context that we might be indicted for for the structural inequality or the poverty or the barriers to migration <unk>  we let ourselves think that human trafficking is only about forced prostitution <unk>  when in reality human trafficking is embedded in our everyday lives  let me show you what i mean forced prostitution accounts for <unk> human trafficking <unk>  ten percent is in state imposed forced labor  but a whopping sixty eight percent is for the purpose of creating the goods and delivering the services that most of us rely on every day  in sectors like agricultural work domestic work and construction <unk>  that is food and care and shelter  and somehow these most essential <unk> workers are also among the world 's most underpaid and exploited today <unk>  human trafficking is the use of force <unk> fraud or coercion to compel another person 's labor  and it 's found in cotton fields <unk> and coltan mines and even car washes in norway and england  it 's found in u s military bases in iraq and afghanistan it 's found in thailand 's fishing industry <unk> industry <unk> that country has become the largest exporter of shrimp in the world <unk>  but what are the circumstances behind all that cheap and plentiful shrimp  thai military were caught selling burmese and cambodian migrants onto fishing boats  those fishing boats were taken out the men put to work and they were thrown overboard if they made the mistake of falling sick or <unk> trying to resist their treatment <unk>  those fish were then used to feed shrimp the shrimp were then sold to four major global retailers <unk>  costco <unk> tesco walmart and carrefour  human trafficking is found on a smaller scale than just that and in places you would never even imagine  traffickers have forced young people to drive ice cream trucks <unk> to sing in touring boys ' choirs  trafficking has even been found in a hair braiding salon in new jersey <unk> the scheme in that case was incredible <unk> the traffickers found young families who were from ghana and togo <unk> and they told these families that your daughters are going to get a fine education in the united <unk> they then located winners of the green card lottery <unk> and they told them we 'll help you out we 'll get you a plane ticket we 'll pay your fees  all you have to do is take this young girl with you say that she 's your sister or your spouse <unk>  once everyone arrived in new jersey the young girls were taken away and put to work for 14 hour days <unk> seven days a week for five years  they made their traffickers nearly four million dollars this is a huge problem so what have we done about it we 've mostly turned to the criminal justice system  but keep in mind most victims of human trafficking are poor and marginalized they 're migrants people of color sometimes they 're in the sex trade <unk>  and for populations like <unk> criminal justice system is too often part of the problem rather than the solution  in study after study in countries ranging from bangladesh to the united states <unk> between twenty and sixty percent of the people in the sex trade who were surveyed said that they had been raped or assaulted by the police in the past year alone  people in prostitution including people who have been trafficked into it regularly receive multiple convictions for prostitution <unk> having that criminal record makes it so much more difficult to leave poverty <unk> leave abuse or leave prostitution if that person so desires  workers outside of the sex sector if they try and resist their treatment <unk> they risk deportation  in case after case i 've studied employers have no problem calling on law enforcement to try and threaten or deport their striking trafficked <unk> workers  if those workers run away <unk> they risk becoming part of the great mass of undocumented workers who are also subject to the whims of law enforcement if they 're caught  law enforcement is supposed to identify victims and prosecute traffickers  but out of an estimated twenty one million victims of human trafficking in the <unk> world they have helped and identified fewer than fifty thousand people that 's like comparing the population of the world to the population of los angeles proportionally speaking  as for convictions  out of an estimated five thousand seven hundred convictions in two thousand and thirteen fewer than five hundred were for labor trafficking  keep in mind that labor <unk> trafficking accounts for sixty eight percent of all trafficking but fewer than ten percent of the convictions  i 've heard one expert say that trafficking happens where need meets greed  i 'd like to add one more element to that  trafficking happens in sectors where workers are excluded from protections and denied the right to organize <unk> trafficking doesn 't happen in a vacuum it happens in systematically degraded work environments  you might be thinking oh she 's talking about failed states or war torn states or i 'm actually talking about the united states <unk>  let me tell you what that looks like  i spent many months researching a trafficking case called global <unk> involving hundreds of thai farm workers they were sent all over the states to work in hawaii pineapple plantations and washington apple orchards and anywhere the work was needed <unk>  they were promised three years of solid agricultural work  so they made a calculated risk <unk> they sold their land <unk> they sold their wives ' jewelry to make thousands in recruitment fees for this company global horizons <unk>  <unk> they were brought over  their passports were confiscated some of the men were beaten and held at gunpoint <unk> they worked so hard they fainted in the fields <unk>  this case hit me so hard  after i came back home <unk> i was wandering through the grocery store and i froze in the produce department <unk>  i was remembering the over the top meals the global horizons survivors would make for me every time i showed up to interview them  <unk> finished one meal with this plate of perfect long stemmed strawberries and as they handed them to me they said  aren 't these the kind of strawberries you eat with somebody special in the states <unk>  and don 't they taste so much better when you know the people whose hands picked them for you  as i stood in that grocery store weeks later <unk> i realized i had no idea <unk> of who to thank for this plenty and no idea of how they were being treated  so like the journalist i am i started digging into the agricultural sector <unk>  and i found there are too many fields and too few labor inspectors  i found multiple layers of plausible deniability between grower and distributor and processor <unk> god knows who else  the global horizons survivors had been brought to the states on a temporary guest worker program  that guest worker program ties a person 's legal status to his or her employer and denies that worker the right to organize <unk>  mind you none of what i am describing about this agricultural sector or the guest worker program is actually <unk> is merely what we find legally tolerable <unk>  and i would argue this is fertile ground for exploitation  and all of this had been hidden to me before i had tried to understand it  i wasn 't the only person grappling with these issues <unk> pierre omidyar <unk> founder of ebay is one of the biggest anti trafficking philanthropists <unk> even he wound up accidentally investing nearly ten million dollars in the pineapple plantation cited as having the worst working conditions in that global horizons case  when he found out he and his wife were shocked and horrified <unk> and they wound up writing an op ed for a newspaper saying that it was up to all of us to learn everything we can about the labor and supply chains of the products that we support totally agree  what would happen if each one of us decided that we are no longer going to support companies if they don 't eliminate exploitation from their labor and supply chains  if we demanded laws calling for the same <unk>  if all the ceos out there decided that they were going to go through their <unk> if we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers if we decided that guest workers should have the right to organize without fear of retaliation <unk>  these would be decisions heard around the world <unk>  this isn 't a matter of buying a fair trade peach and calling it a day <unk> buying a guilt free zone with your money that 's not how it works <unk> this is the decision to change a system that is broken <unk> and that we have unwittingly but willingly allowed ourselves to profit from and benefit from for too long  we often dwell on human trafficking survivors ' victimization <unk>  but that is not my experience of them  over all the years that i 've been talking to them they have <unk> taught me that we are more than our worst days each one of us is more than what we have lived through  especially trafficking survivors  these people were the most resourceful and resilient and responsible in their communities <unk>  they were the people that you would take a gamble on you 'd say i 'm gong to sell my rings because i have the chance to send you off to a better future <unk>  they were the emissaries of hope  <unk> survivors don 't need saving <unk>  they need solidarity <unk> because they 're behind some of the most exciting social justice movements out there today <unk>  the nannies and housekeepers who marched with their families and their employers ' families their activism got us an international treaty on domestic workers <unk> the nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade they came together and they decided that they were going to make the world 's first anti trafficking organization actually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves  these indian shipyard workers were trafficked to do post hurricane katrina reconstruction  they were threatened with deportation but they broke out of their work compound and they marched from new orleans to washington d c to protest labor <unk> exploitation <unk> they cofounded an organization called the national guest worker alliance <unk> and through this organization <unk> they have wound up helping other workers bring to light exploitation and abuses in supply chains in walmart and hershey 's factories <unk> and although the department of justice declined to take their case  a team of civil rights lawyers won the first of a dozen civil suits this <unk> february and got their clients fourteen million dollars  these survivors are fighting for people they don 't even know yet <unk>  other workers <unk> and for the possibility of a just world for all of us  this is our chance to do the same <unk>  this is our chance to make the decision that tells us who we are as a people and as a society <unk> that our prosperity <unk> is no longer prosperity as long as it is pinned to other people 's pain <unk>  that our lives are inextricably woven together <unk>  and that we have the power to make a different choice <unk>  i was so reluctant to share my story of my auntie with you <unk> before i started this ted process and climbed up on this stage <unk> told literally a handful of people about it  because like many a journalist i am far more interested in learning about your stories than sharing much if anything about my own <unk>  i also haven 't done my journalistic due diligence on this i haven 't issued my mountains of document requests and interviewed everyone and their mother <unk>  and i haven 't found my auntie yet <unk> i don 't know her story of what happened <unk> and of her life now  the story as i 've told it to you is messy and unfinished <unk>  but i think it mirrors the messy and unfinished situation we 're all in when it comes to human trafficking <unk>  we are all implicated in this problem  but that means we are all also part of its solution <unk>  figuring out <unk> to build a more just world is our work to do and our story to tell  so let us tell it the way we should have done from the very beginning let us tell this story together <unk> thank you so much
