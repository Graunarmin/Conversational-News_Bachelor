 <unk> a story  it 's an indian story about an indian woman and her journey <unk> let me begin with my parents <unk>  i 'm a product of this visionary mother and father  <unk> didn 't belong to girls in india <unk> they belonged to boys <unk> they belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents and girls would be dolled up to get married  my family in my city and almost in the country was unique <unk> we were four of us not one <unk> and fortunately no boys <unk> we were four girls and no boys <unk> and my parents were part of a landed property family <unk> father defied his own grandfather almost to the point of disinheritance because he decided to educate all four of us  he sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education as i 've said when we 're born we don 't choose our parents <unk> and when we go to school we don 't choose our school <unk> children <unk> <unk> don 't choose a school they just get the school which parents choose for them <unk> so this is the foundation time which i got i grew up <unk> up like this and so did my other three sisters <unk> and my father used to say at that time i 'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world i don 't know if he really meant [ that ] but it happened i 'm the only one who 's left in india <unk> one is a british another is an american and the third is a canadian <unk> so we are four of us in four corners of the world <unk>  and since i said they 're my role models i followed two things which my father and mother gave me one <unk> said life is on an incline you either go up <unk> or you come down  and the second thing which has stayed with me which became my philosophy of life which made all the difference is one hundred things happen in your life good or bad <unk>  out of one hundred ninety are your creation <unk> they 're good they 're your creation <unk> enjoy it  if they 're bad <unk> they 're your creation <unk> learn from it ten are you can 't do a thing it 's like a death of a relative or a cyclone or a hurricane or an earthquake you can 't do a thing about it you 've got to just respond to the situation but <unk> <unk> that response comes out of those ninety points since i 'm a product of this philosophy  <unk> to be valuing what i got i 'm a product of opportunities rare opportunities in the ' 50s and the ' 60s which girls didn 't get and i was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving <unk> <unk> me was something unique because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry and here i was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities i thought i must tell you this <unk> why i said this is the background <unk>  <unk> service as a tough woman  a woman with indefatigable stamina because i used to run for my tennis titles etc but i joined the indian police service <unk>  and then it was a new pattern of policing for me the policing stood for power to correct  power to prevent and power to detect <unk> this is something like a new definition <unk> ever given in policing in india the power to prevent because normally it was always said <unk> power to detect <unk> and that 's it <unk> or power to punish but i decided no it 's a power to prevent <unk> because that 's what i learned when i was growing up how do i prevent the ten and never make it more than ten so this was how it came into my service <unk> and it was different from the men <unk> i <unk> didn 't want to make it different from the men <unk> but it was different <unk> because this was the way i was different <unk> and i redefined policing concepts in india <unk> two journeys my policing journey and my prison journey what you see if you see the title called pm 's car held  this was the first time a prime minister of india was given a parking ticket  that 's the first time in india and i can tell you that 's the last time you 're hearing about it it 'll never happen again in india because now it was once and forever <unk> and the rule was because i was sensitive i was compassionate i was very sensitive to injustice <unk> and i was very pro justice that 's the reason as a woman i joined the indian police service i had other options <unk> but <unk> <unk> i didn 't choose them <unk> so i 'm going to move on this is about tough policing equal policing  <unk> postings which others would say no i now went to a prison assignment as a police officer normally police officers don 't want to do prison  they sent me to prison to lock me up thinking now there will be no cars and no vips to be given tickets to let 's lock her up  here i got a prison assignment this was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals <unk>  obviously it was <unk> but ten thousand men of which only four hundred were women ten thousand nine thousand plus about six hundred were men <unk> terrorists <unk>  rapists  burglars <unk> gangsters some of them i 'd sent to jail as as a police officer outside and then how did i deal with them the first day when i went in i didn 't know how to look <unk> <unk> at them <unk> and i said do you pray when i looked at the group i said do you pray they saw me as a young short woman wearing <unk> all right let 's pray i prayed for them <unk> and things started to change <unk> this is a visual of education inside the prison friends this has never happened <unk> where everybody in <unk> <unk> the prison studies <unk> i started this with community support government had no budget it was one of the finest <unk> largest volunteerism in any prison in the world <unk> this was initiated in delhi prison you see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class <unk> these are hundreds of classes nine to eleven <unk> every prisoner went into the education program the same den in which they thought they would put me behind <unk> <unk> the bar and things would be forgotten we converted this into an ashram from a prison to an ashram through education  <unk> the beginning of a change <unk> teachers were prisoners <unk>  teachers were volunteers <unk> books came from donated schoolbooks <unk> stationery was donated <unk> everything was donated <unk> because there was no budget of education for the prison  now if i 'd not done that it would have been a hellhole <unk> that 's the second landmark i want to show you some moments of history in my journey which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in <unk> the numbers you 'll never get to see secondly this concept <unk> this was a meditation program inside the prison of over one thousand prisoners  one thousand prisoners who sat in meditation this was one of the most courageous steps i took as a prison governor and this is what transformed you want to know more about <unk> <unk> this go and see this film doing time doing vipassana you will hear about it <unk> and you will love it <unk> and write to me on <unk> let me show you the next slide <unk> i took the same concept of mindfulness because why did i bring meditation into the indian prison <unk> because crime is a product of a distorted mind  it was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control not by preaching not by telling not by reading <unk> but by addressing your mind <unk> i took the same thing to the police <unk> because police equally were prisoners of their minds <unk> and they felt as if it was this is a feedback box called a petition box <unk> this is a concept which i introduced to listen to complaints <unk> listen to grievances <unk> this was a magic box <unk> this was a sensitive box <unk>  this is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison if you see somebody in the blue yeah <unk> this guy he was a <unk> and he was a teacher <unk> and you see everybody 's busy there was no time to waste let me wrap it up <unk> i 'm currently into movements  movements of education of <unk> the under served children which is thousands india is all about thousands  secondly is about the anti corruption movement in india that 's a big way we as a small group of activists have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of india <unk> <unk> friends you will hear a lot about it that 's the movement at the moment i 'm driving and <unk> that 's the movement and ambition of my life
