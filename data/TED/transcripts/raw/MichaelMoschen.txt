 <unk> i started juggling a long time ago but long before that i was a golfer and that 's what i was a golfer and as a golfer and as a kid one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores that i sort of lived my whole life is process <unk> process and it 's the process of learning things one of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer but he was lefty <unk>  and he had a real passion for golf and he also created this whole mythology about ben hogan and various things <unk> well <unk> i learned a lot about interesting things that i knew nothing about at the time but grew to know know stuff about <unk> and that was the mythology of skill so one of the things that i love to do is to explore skill and since richard put me on this whole thing with music i 'm supposed to actually be doing a project with tod machover with the mit media lab it relates a lot to music <unk>  but tod couldn 't come and the project is sort of somewhere i 'm not sure whether it 's happening the way we thought or not <unk> but i 'm going to explore skill and <unk> visual music i guess <unk> ok you can start the music the <unk> can be a lot of fun play with skill and play with space play with rhythm and you can turn the mike on now <unk> do a couple of pieces i do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it <unk> part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands because a lot of juggling is <unk> <unk> hand oriented but using the rhythm of my body and feet <unk> and controlling the balls with my feet <unk> next section was an attempt to explore space you see i think richard said something about people that are against something <unk> well a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff well i kind of from my childhood and golf and all that it 's a process of joining with forces <unk> so what i 'd like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique <unk> so juggling gravity up down if you figure out what up and down really are it 's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up <unk> but then you add in sideways <unk> i look at it somewhat as a way when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes and see with your hands because you 're not looking at your hands you 're looking at where the balls are or you 're looking at the audience  so this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm  with the obvious reference to the feet <unk> but it 's also where the feet were where the balls were <unk> and remember you 're transposing you 're getting into a subculture here  and juggling the balls cross and all that ok if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights <unk> but then hopefully even rhythm and you can change the rhythm good you can change the rhythm if you get out of the lights <unk> ok <unk> change the rhythm so it 's even or you can go back and change the height <unk>  now <unk> skill <unk> <unk> but you 're boxed in if you can only do it up and down that way so you 've got to go after the space down there <unk> because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you and then you get crazy <unk> i 'm actually going to ask you to try something so you 've got to pay attention <unk> complexity if you spend enough time doing something time slows down or your skill increases so your perceptions perceptions change  it 's learning skills like being in a high speed car crash  things slow down as you learn as you learn as you learn <unk> you may not be able to affect it <unk> almost drifts on you it goes <unk> but that 's the closest approximation i can have to it <unk> so <unk> complexity now how many here are jugglers ok <unk> so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this <unk> it looks like a mess it looks like a mess with a guy there who 's got his hands around that mess <unk> ok <unk> well that 's what juggling is about right it 's being able to do something that other people can 't do or can 't understand all right so that 's one way of doing it which is five balls down <unk> ok <unk> another way <unk> but let 's try something <unk> ok <unk> so since you all don 't understand what the five ball pattern is i 'm going <unk> let 's actually learn something actually <unk> let me put you in that area of learning which is very insecure <unk> what you 're going to learn is this  ok <unk> so what i want you to do is just listen to me and do it <unk> lot of different learning processes going on in here  one learning process that i see is this  <unk> shake your hands out <unk> now <unk> i assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer <unk> ok <unk> so what you 're doing is you 're going la <unk> and you 're getting this <unk> ok <unk> so that 's exactly what i 'm going to ask you to do but in a slightly different way <unk> you 're going to combine it <unk> so what i want you to do is fingers i 'll tell you what to do with your fingers same thing but i want you to do is also with your eyes is follow the colored ball that i ask you to follow  <unk> going to start off looking at the white ball and i 'm going to tell you which color and i 'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers <unk> reason i wanted you to do this is because that 's actually what most people face throughout their lives <unk> a moment of learning a moment of challenge it 's a moment that you can 't make sense of why the hell should i <unk> anything to do with anything in my life you know i can 't decipher is it fun is it challenging am i supposed to cheat you know what are you supposed to do you 've got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life <unk>  ok <unk> trying to figure that stuff out but is it going to get you anywhere <unk> it 's just a moment <unk> that 's all it is a moment <unk> ok <unk> i 'm going to change the script for one second just let me do this i don 't need music for it talking about time in a moment there 's a piece that i recently developed which was all about that <unk>  a moment <unk>  and what i do as a creative artist is i develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects what i 've done for you here <unk> i developed a lot of those tricks and i put the choreography together <unk> but they 're not original techniques <unk> i 'm going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that i 've developed ok <unk> so <unk> a moment <unk> how would you define a moment <unk> well as a juggler  what i wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment <unk> what i did as a juggler was say ok <unk> what can i do to make that something that is dependent on something else <unk> something in here and you can all have a guess as to what it is there 's a mystery there 's a mystery in the moment <unk> and it and then it 's dependent on something else <unk> and then it comes to rest  just a little thing about time now this has expanded into a much bigger piece because i use ramps of different parabolas that i roll the balls on while i 'm keeping time with this <unk> but i just thought i 'd talk about a moment <unk> can we show the video of the triangle are we ready to do that yes  this is the piece that i told you about it 's a much bigger piece that i do exploring the space of a geometric triangle <unk> ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at one hundred and twenty miles an hour  the only other thing is it was a real shock i always drove motorcycles <unk> and when i bought my first car  it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents ' house <unk> making up the rules so you can 't cheat <unk> so you learn to approach stillness <unk> with different parts of your body  to have a conversation with it  to speak  to listen hup  now it 's dependent on rhythm and keeping a center of balance when it falls going <unk> a rhythm to it  the rhythm can get much smaller  as your skill increases you learn to find those tinier spaces  those tinier movements thanks now i 'm going to show you the beginnings piece that is about balance in some ways <unk> and also oh actually <unk> if you 're bored not here here 's one use for it  the the the <unk> i apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb square and level <unk>  and they influenced that and this next piece which i 'll do a little segment of two sticks you can go with it thanks <unk>  which is again exploring space <unk> working with space and the lines in space in a different way <unk> time <unk> but working with one ball now what if you attach something to it or change it this is a little thing that i made because i really like the idea of curves and balls <unk> and then creating space and the rhythm of space using the surface of the balls the surface of the arms just a little toy <unk>  which leads me to the next thing <unk> which is what have i got here <unk> i 'm actually leading up to something <unk> the newest thing that i 'm working on this is not it <unk> this is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape <unk> just did was i worked with the mathematics the diameter and the circumference <unk> sometimes these pieces are mathematical in that way that i look at a shape and say what about <unk> i use this and this and this sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that i try to work with the next piece that i 'm going to do which is the cylinders piece if you want to get that up it has to do with cylinder seals from about five thousand years ago which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs i love ceramics and all of that it 's a combination of that <unk> the beauty of that <unk> the shape  and the stories that were involved in it as well as the fact that they protected the contents the second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness so if you want to go with the music for cylinders the the the the the the <unk> talking about geometry and everything <unk> if you take the circle and you split it in half can you run s curve music i 'm going to do just a short version of it <unk> circles split in half the <unk> kinetic sculpture in the middle of it and i dance around a small stage so two minutes just to end the latest piece that i 'm working on what i love is that i never know what i 'm working on why i 'm working on it <unk> they 're not ideas they 're instincts and the latest thing that i 'm working on something really i don 't know what it is yet <unk>  and that 's good <unk> i like not to know for as long as possible <unk> well because then it tells me the truth <unk> instead of me imposing the truth <unk> <unk> is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves and what it involves and i don 't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not but i 'll do a little bit of it <unk> it initially started off with me stacking these things bunches of them <unk> and then playing with the sense of space of filling in the space and then it started <unk> and become folding on themselves and then changing levels  because my attempt is to make visual instruments not to just make i 'll try one other thing  for work in three dimensions with your <unk> perceptions of space and time <unk> now i don 't know exactly where it 's going but i 've got a bit bit of effort involved in this thing <unk> and it 's going to change as i go through it <unk>  but i really like it it feels right <unk> this may not be the right shape  and look at this shape and then i 'll show you the first design i ever put to it <unk>  just to see just to play i love all different kinds of things to play with let 's see here to work with the positive and negative in a different way <unk>  and to change <unk> and to change so i 'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space we 'll see what i come
