 <unk> i was born and raised in sierra leone a small and very beautiful country in west africa a country rich both in physical resources and creative <unk> rebel war in the ' 90s when entire villages were burnt down  an estimated eight thousand men <unk> women and children had their arms and legs amputated during this time <unk>  as my family and i ran for safety when i was about twelve from one of those attacks i resolved that i would do <unk> everything i could to ensure that my own children would not go through the same experiences we had they would in fact be part of a sierra leone where war and amputation were no longer a strategy for gaining power <unk>  as i watched people who i knew loved ones <unk> recover from this devastation one thing that deeply troubled me <unk> was that many of the amputees in the country would not use their prostheses the reason i would come to find out  was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well  the prosthetic socket is the part in which the amputee inserts their residual limb  and which connects to the prosthetic ankle <unk> even in the developed world <unk> it takes a period of three weeks to often years for a patient to get a comfortable socket <unk> ever <unk> prosthetists still use conventional processes like molding and casting to create <unk> prosthetic sockets  such sockets often leave intolerable amounts of pressure on the limbs of the patient <unk> leaving them with pressure sores and blisters <unk> does not matter how powerful your prosthetic ankle is  if your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable you will not use your leg <unk> and that is just simply unacceptable in our age  so one day when i met professor hugh herr about two and a half years ago and he asked me if i knew how to solve this problem i said no not yet  but i would love to figure it out <unk> at the mit media lab i designed custom prosthetic sockets quickly and cheaply that are more comfortable than conventional prostheses <unk>  i used magnetic resonance imaging to capture the actual shape of the patient 's anatomy then use finite element modeling to better predict the internal stresses and strains on the normal forces  and then create a prosthetic socket <unk> manufacture <unk> we use a 3d printer to create a <unk> <unk> prosthetic socket which relieves pressure where needed on the anatomy of the patient in short we 're using data to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply in a recent trial we just wrapped up at the media lab <unk> one of our patients a u s veteran who has been an amputee for about twenty years and worn dozens of legs said of one of our printed parts it 's so soft <unk> it 's like walking on pillows <unk> and it 's effing sexy <unk> in our age should not prevent anyone from living meaningful lives  my hope and desire is that the tools and processes we develop in our research group can be used to bring highly functional prostheses to those who need them  for me  a place to begin healing the souls of those affected by war and disease is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces for their bodies <unk>  whether it 's in sierra leone or in boston i hope this not only restores but indeed transforms their sense of human potential <unk> thank you very much
