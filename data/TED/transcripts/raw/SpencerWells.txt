 <unk> these are a few of the languages that i 've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six <unk> as i 've been to seventeen countries i think i 'm up to on this crazy tour i 've been doing  checking out various aspects of the project that we 're doing and i 'm going to tell you a little bit about later on and visiting some pretty incredible places  places like mongolia <unk> cambodia <unk> new guinea south africa <unk> tanzania twice i was here a month ago <unk>  and the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing for lots of reasons you see some incredible stuff <unk> and you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe <unk>  and the thing that you really take away from that the kind of surface thing that you take away from it  is not that we 're all one  although i 'm going to tell you about that  but rather how different we are there is so much diversity around the globe <unk>  six thousand different languages spoken by six and a half billion people all different colors shapes sizes you <unk> walk down the street in any big city you travel like that and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species <unk>  how do we explain that diversity <unk>  well <unk> that 's what i 'm going to talk about today is how we 're using the tools of genetics population genetics in particular to tell us how we generated this diversity <unk> and how long it took  now the problem of human diversity like all big scientific questions how do you explain something like that can be broken down into sub questions and you can ferret away at those little sub questions  first one is really a question of origins do we all share a common origin in fact and given that we do and that 's the assumption everybody i think in this room would make when when was that <unk> when did we originate as a species how long have we been divergent from each other <unk>  and the second question is related but <unk> slightly different if we do spring from a common source how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe and in the process generate all of this diversity the different ways of life the different appearances the different languages around the world well the question of origins as with so many other questions in biology seems to have been answered by darwin over a century ago in the descent of man he wrote in each great region of the world the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region  <unk> that africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee <unk>  and as these two species are now man 's nearest allies it 's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the african continent than elsewhere  so we 're done we can go home finished the origin question well not quite because darwin was talking about our distant ancestry <unk> our common ancestry with apes <unk> and it is quite clear that apes originated on the african continent around twenty three million years ago they appear in the fossil record  africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time due to the vagaries of plate tectonics floating around the indian ocean  bumped into eurasia around sixteen million years ago and then we had the first african exodus as we call it the apes that left at that time ended up in southeast asia became the gibbons and the orangutans and the ones that stayed on in africa evolved into the gorillas the chimpanzees and us so yes if you 're talking about our common ancestry with apes it 's very clear by looking at the fossil record we started off here <unk> but that 's not really the question i 'm asking i 'm asking about our human ancestry things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room if they were peering over your shoulder <unk> you wouldn 't leap back like that  what about our human ancestry because if we go far enough back we share a common ancestry with every living thing on earth <unk> dna ties us all together so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria and mushrooms <unk> if you go far enough back over a billion years  what we 're asking about though is human ancestry how do we study that well historically it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology <unk> digging things up out of the ground <unk>  and largely on the basis of morphology the way things are shaped often skull shape saying this looks a little bit more like us than that <unk> so this must be my ancestor this must be who i 'm directly descended from  the field of paleoanthropology i 'll argue gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry but it doesn 't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists what do i mean by that you 're looking at a great example here these are three extinct species of hominids potential human ancestors  all dug up just west of here in olduvai gorge by the leakey family and they 're all dating to roughly the same time from left to right we 've got homo erectus homo habilis and australopithecus now called paranthropus boisei the robust australopithecine  three extinct species same place same time  that means that not all three could be my direct ancestor which one of these guys am i actually related to  possibilities about our ancestry but not the probabilities that we 're really looking for well <unk> a different approach has <unk> been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently again largely skull shape the first person to do this systematically was linnaeus <unk> carl von linne a swedish botanist who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet you think you 've got a tough job <unk> and he did a pretty good job he categorized about twelve thousand species in <unk> naturae he actually coined the term homo sapiens it means wise man in latin <unk>  but looking around the world at the diversity of humans he said well you know we seem to come in discreet sub species or categories  and he talked about africans and americans and asians and europeans and a blatantly racist category he termed monstrosus  which basically included all the people he didn 't like including imaginary folk like elves it 's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre darwinian era except <unk> <unk> if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as twenty or thirty years ago in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity human races <unk> is the best example had been diverging from each other this was in the post darwinian era for over a million years since the time of homo erectus <unk> but based on what data  very little very little morphology and a lot of guesswork <unk>  well <unk> what i 'm going to talk about today what i 'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry digging things up out of the ground possible ancestors and saying <unk> on the basis of morphology which we still don 't completely understand we don 't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation what we need to do is turn the problem on its head because what we 're really asking is a genealogical problem or a genealogical question what we 're trying to do is construct a family <unk> <unk> tree for everybody alive today <unk> and as any genealogist will tell you anybody have a member of the family or maybe you have tried to <unk> a family tree trace back in time you start in the present with relationships you 're certain about you and your siblings you have a parent in common you and your cousins share a grandparent in common you gradually trace further and further back into the past <unk>  adding these ever more distant relationships but eventually <unk>  no matter how good you are at digging up the church records and all that stuff <unk> you hit what the genealogists call a <unk> a point beyond which you don 't know anything else about your ancestors and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance who were these people who came before <unk>  we have no written record well <unk> actually we do  written in our dna in our genetic code we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species <unk> and that 's what we study  now a quick primer on dna i suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist it is a very long <unk> linear molecule a coded version of how to make another copy of you it 's your blueprint <unk>  it 's composed of four subunits a c g and t we call them and it 's the sequence of those subunits that that defines that blueprint  how long is it well it 's billions of these subunits in length <unk> a haploid genome we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes a haploid genome is around three point two billion nucleotides in length <unk> thing if you add it all together is over six billion nucleotides long if you take all the dna out of one cell in your body and stretch it end to end it 's around two meters long <unk>  if you take all the dna out of every cell in your body and you stretch it end to end <unk> it would reach from here to the moon and back thousands of times it 's a lot of information <unk> and so when you 're copying this dna molecule to pass it on it 's a pretty tough job <unk> imagine the longest book you can think of war and peace now multiply it by one hundred  and imagine copying that by hand <unk>  and you 're working away until late at night and you 're very very careful and you 're drinking coffee and you 're paying attention but occasionally  when you 're copying this by hand you 're going to make a little typo <unk> a spelling mistake substitute an i for an e or a c for a t same thing happens to our dna as it 's being passed <unk> on through the generations it doesn 't happen very often we have a proofreading mechanism built in  but when it does happen and these changes get transmitted down through the generations they become markers of descent if you share a marker with someone it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past <unk> the person who first had that change in their dna <unk>  and it 's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation the pattern <unk> these markers in people all over the world and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history that we 've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today these are two pieces of dna <unk> <unk> that we use quite widely in our work mitochondrial dna tracing a purely maternal line of descent you get your mtdna from your mother and your mother 's mother  <unk> falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees <unk>  now even though these are simplified versions of the real trees <unk> they 're still kind of complicated so let 's simplify them turn them on their sides combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up  what 's the take home message <unk> well <unk> the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within africa that means that africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer <unk>  and what that means is that we originated in africa <unk> it 's written in our dna every piece of dna we look at has greater diversity within africa than outside of africa <unk>  and at some point in the past a sub group of africans left the african continent to go out and populate the rest of the world <unk>  now how recently do we share this <unk> ancestry was it millions of years ago <unk>  which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world <unk> no the dna tells a story that 's very clear within the last two hundred thousand years <unk> we all share an ancestor <unk> a single person mitochondrial eve you might have heard about her in africa <unk> an african woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today <unk> but what 's even more amazing is that if you look at the y chromosome side the male side of the story <unk>  the y chromosome adam only lived around sixty thousand years ago <unk> that 's only about two thousand human generations <unk> the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense that tells us we were all still living in africa at that time this was an african man who gave rise to all the y chromosome diversity around the world <unk> it 's only within the last sixty thousand years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world <unk>  such an amazing story we 're all effectively part of an extended african family <unk>  now <unk> that seems so recent <unk> why didn 't we start to leave earlier why didn 't homo erectus evolve into separate species or sub species rather human races around the world <unk> why was it that we we seem to have come out of africa so recently <unk> in genetics and the study of history in general are always the big ones the ones that are tough to answer and so when all else fails talk about the weather  what was going on to the world 's weather around sixty thousand years ago well <unk> we were going into the worst part of the last ice age the last ice age started roughly one hundred and twenty thousand years ago <unk> it went up and down <unk> and it really started to accelerate around seventy thousand years ago lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types oxygen isotopes and <unk> so on we hit the last glacial maximum around sixteen thousand years ago <unk> but basically from seventy thousand years on things were getting really tough  getting very cold the northern hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets  new york city <unk> chicago seattle all under a sheet of ice most of britain all of scandinavia covered by ice several kilometers thick now africa is the most tropical continent on the planet about eighty five percent of it lies between cancer and capricorn and there aren 't a lot of glaciers here <unk> except on the high mountains here in east africa so what was going on here we weren 't covered in ice in africa <unk>  rather africa was drying out at that time this is a <unk> <unk> map of what africa looked like between sixty thousand and seventy thousand years ago <unk> reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that i mentioned before <unk> the reason for that is that ice actually <unk> sucks moisture out of the atmosphere if you think about antarctica it 's technically a desert <unk> it gets so little precipitation  so the whole world was drying out the sea levels were dropping and africa was turning to desert the sahara was much bigger then than it is now <unk>  and the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets compared to what we have today <unk>  the evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time roughly seventy thousand <unk> years ago crashed to fewer than two thousand individuals <unk> we nearly went extinct we were hanging on by our fingernails <unk>  and then something happened a great illustration of it look at some stone tools <unk> the ones on the left are from africa <unk> from around a million years ago <unk> the ones on the right were made by neanderthals our distant cousins not our direct <unk> living in europe and they date from around fifty thousand or sixty thousand years ago <unk>  now at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience  basically there 's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups the ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right we are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around sixty thousand to seventy thousand years ago <unk> the tool styles don 't change that much the evidence is that the human way of life didn 't change that much <unk> during that period  but then fifty sixty seventy thousand years ago somewhere in that region all hell breaks loose <unk> art makes its appearance <unk>  the stone tools become much more finely crafted <unk>  the evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species at particular times of the year <unk> the population size started to expand  <unk> according to what many linguists believe fully modern language syntactic language subject verb object that we use to convey complex ideas like i 'm doing now <unk> appeared around that time <unk> we became much more social the social networks expanded  this change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in africa <unk> and they allowed us to start to expand around the world <unk> we 've been talking at this conference about african success stories <unk> well <unk> you want the ultimate african success story <unk> look in the mirror you 're it the reason you 're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in africa probably somewhere in the region where we 're sitting right now around sixty seventy thousand years ago allowing us not only to survive in africa but to expand out of africa an early coastal migration along the south coast of asia leaving africa around sixty thousand years ago <unk> reaching australia very rapidly by fifty thousand years ago a <unk> later migration up into the middle east these would have been savannah hunters <unk> so those of you who are going on one of the post conference tours you 'll get to see what a real savannah is like and it 's basically a meat locker people <unk> <unk> who would have specialized in killing the animals hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs moving up following the grasslands into the middle east around forty five thousand years ago <unk> during <unk> the rare wet phases in the sahara  migrating eastward <unk> following the grasslands because that 's what they were adapted to live on  and when they reached central asia <unk> they reached what was effectively a steppe <unk> super highway a grassland super highway the grasslands at that time this was during the last ice age stretched basically from germany all the way over to korea <unk>  and the entire continent was open to them <unk> entering europe around thirty five thousand years ago and finally a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable  siberia inside the arctic circle <unk> during the last ice age temperature was at minus seventy minus eighty even minus one hundred perhaps migrating into the americas ultimately reaching that final frontier an amazing <unk> <unk> story <unk> and it happened first in africa the changes that allowed us to do that the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us allowing us to create novel cultures <unk> allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one i 've just been on  now <unk> that story i just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world the great paleolithic wanderings of our species <unk>  and that 's the story that i told a couple of years ago in my book the journey of man and a film that we made with the same title <unk> and as we were finishing up that film it was co produced with national geographic i started talking to the folks at <unk> and they got really excited about it <unk> they liked the film but they said you know we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins where we all came from using the tools of dna to map the migrations around the world you know the study of human origins is kind of in our dna and we want to take it to the next level what do you want to do next  which is a great question to be asked by national geographic <unk> well <unk> you know <unk> what i 've sketched out here is just that <unk> it is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet <unk> and it 's based on a few thousand people we 've sampled from you know  a handful of populations around the world studied a a few genetic markers  and there are lots of gaps on this map we 've just connected the dots what we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more hundreds of thousands of dna samples from people all over the world <unk> and that was the genesis of the genographic project  the project launched in april two thousand and five <unk> it has three core components <unk> obviously <unk> science is a big part of it the field research that we 're doing around the world with indigenous peoples  <unk> people who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live <unk> so my ancestors come from all over northern europe i live in the eastern seaboard of north america when i 'm not traveling  where am i indigenous to nowhere really my genes are all jumbled up but there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the dna results <unk> that 's the focus of the field research the centers that we 've set up all over the world ten of them top population geneticists  <unk> how often do you get to participate in a big scientific project the human genome project or a mars rover mission in this case you actually can you can go onto our website <unk> genographic you can order a kit you can test your own dna <unk>  and you can actually submit those results to the database and tell us a little about your genealogical background have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort  now this is all a <unk> and so the money that we raise after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components gets plowed back into the project the majority going to something we call the legacy fund it 's a charitable entity basically a grant giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational cultural projects initiated by them they apply to this fund in order to do various projects and i 'll show you a couple of examples <unk> so how are we doing on the <unk> we 've got about twenty five thousand samples collected from indigenous people around the world <unk>  the most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public two hundred and ten thousand people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago <unk> which has raised around five million dollars <unk> <unk> the majority of which at least half is going back into the legacy fund <unk> we 've just awarded the first legacy grants totaling around five hundred thousand dollars  preserving traditional weaving patterns in gaza language revitalization in tajikistan etc etc <unk>  so the project is going very very well <unk> and i urge you to check out the website and watch this space
