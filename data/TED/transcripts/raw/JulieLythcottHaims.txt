 <unk> you know i didn 't set out to be a parenting expert  in fact i 'm not very interested in parenting per se it 's just that there 's a certain style of parenting these days that is kind of messing up kids <unk> to develop into <unk> there 's a certain style of parenting these days that 's getting in the way <unk> i guess what i 'm saying is <unk> we spend a lot of time being very concerned about parents who aren 't involved enough in the lives of their kids and their education or their upbringing <unk> and rightly so but at the other end of the spectrum  there 's a lot of harm going on there as well where parents feel a kid can 't be <unk> successful unless the parent is protecting and preventing at every turn and hovering over every happening and micromanaging every moment and steering their kid towards some small subset of colleges and careers  when we raise kids this way <unk> and i 'll say we  <unk> because lord knows in raising my two teenagers <unk> i 've had these tendencies myself our kids end up leading a kind of checklisted childhood <unk> and here 's what the checklisted childhood looks like we keep them safe and sound and fed and watered <unk>  and then we want to be sure they go to the right schools that they 're in the right classes at the right schools and that they get the right grades in the right classes in the right schools <unk> but not just the grades the scores  and not just the grades and scores but the accolades <unk> and the awards and the sports the activities the leadership we tell our kids don 't just join a club start a club <unk> because colleges want to see that  and check the box for community service i mean show the colleges you care about others  and all of this is done to some hoped for degree of perfection  we expect our kids to perform at a level of perfection we were never asked to perform <unk> at ourselves and so because so much is required we think  well then of course we parents have to argue with every teacher and principal and coach and referee and act like our kid 's concierge and personal handler and secretary <unk> and then with our kids our precious kids we spend so much time nudging cajoling hinting helping haggling <unk> nagging as the case may be to be sure they 're not screwing up not closing doors  not ruining their future some hoped for admission to a tiny handful of colleges that deny almost every applicant <unk>  and here 's what it feels like to be a kid in this <unk> first of all there 's no time for free play there 's no room in the afternoons because everything has to be enriching we think  it 's as if every piece of homework every quiz every activity is a make or break moment for this future we have in mind for them and we absolve them of helping out around the house <unk> and we even absolve them of getting enough sleep as long as they 're checking off the items <unk> on their checklist and in the checklisted childhood we say we just want them to be happy <unk>  but when they come home from school <unk> what we ask about all too often first is their homework and their grades and they see in our faces that our approval that our love <unk> that their very worth  <unk> and then we walk alongside them and offer clucking praise like a trainer at the westminster dog show  coaxing them to just jump a little higher and soar a little farther day after day after day and when they get to high <unk> <unk> school <unk> they don 't say well what might i be interested in studying or doing as an activity they go to counselors and they say what do i need to do to get into the right college <unk> and then when the grades start to roll in in high school and they 're getting some b 's or god forbid some c 's  they frantically text their friends and say has anyone ever gotten into the right college with these grades and our kids <unk> regardless of where they end up at the end of high school <unk> they 're breathless  they 're brittle <unk> they 're a little burned out they 're a little old before their time wishing the grown ups in their lives had said what you 've done is enough this effort you 've put forth in childhood is enough  and they 're withering now under high rates of anxiety and depression and some of them are wondering <unk>  will this life ever turn out to have been worth <unk> we parents we parents are pretty sure it 's all worth it <unk>  we seem to behave it 's like we literally think they will have no future if they don 't get into one of these tiny set of colleges or careers we have in mind for them  or maybe <unk> maybe we 're just afraid they won 't have a future we can brag about to our friends and with stickers on the backs of our cars but if you look at what we 've done if you have the courage to really look at it  you 'll see that not only do our kids think their worth comes from grades and scores <unk>  but that when we live right up inside their precious developing minds all the time like our very own version of the movie being john <unk> malkovich we send our children the message hey kid <unk> i don 't think you can actually achieve any of this without me  and so with our overhelp our overprotection and overdirection and hand holding we deprive our kids of the chance to build <unk> which is a really fundamental <unk> of the human psyche far more important than that self esteem they get every time we applaud is built when one sees that one 's own actions lead to outcomes <unk> not there you go  not one 's parents ' actions on one 's behalf <unk>  but when one 's own actions lead to outcomes so simply put if our children are to develop <unk> and they must  then they have to do a whole lot more of the thinking <unk> planning <unk> deciding doing hoping coping trial and error <unk> dreaming and experiencing of life for themselves <unk> now <unk> am i saying every kid is <unk> and motivated and doesn 't need a parent 's involvement or interest in their lives and we should just back off and let go <unk> hell no  that is not what i 'm saying what i 'm saying is when we treat grades and scores and accolades and awards as the purpose of childhood all in furtherance of some <unk> hoped for admission to a tiny number of colleges or entrance to a small number of careers <unk> that that 's too narrow a definition of success for our kids  some short term wins by overhelping like they get a better grade if we help them do their homework <unk> they might end up with a longer childhood rsum when we help what i 'm saying is is that all of this comes at a long term cost to their sense of self  what i 'm saying is we should be less concerned with the specific set of colleges they might be able to apply to or might get into and far more concerned that they have the habits the mindset <unk> the skill set the wellness to be successful wherever they go <unk>  what i 'm saying is our kids need us to be a little less obsessed with grades and scores and a whole lot more interested in childhood providing <unk> i just say chores did i just say chores <unk> i really did  but really here 's why <unk>  the longest longitudinal study of humans ever conducted is called the harvard grant study it found that <unk> professional success in life which is what we want for our kids <unk>  that professional success in life comes from having done chores as a kid and the earlier you started the better that <unk> <unk> mindset a mindset that says <unk> there 's some unpleasant work <unk> someone 's got to do it it might as well be me a mindset that says <unk> i will contribute my effort to the betterment of the whole that that 's what gets you ahead in the workplace now we all know this you know this  we all know this and yet in the <unk> checklisted childhood we absolve our kids of doing the work of chores around the house <unk>  and then they end up as young adults in the workplace still waiting for a checklist <unk> but it doesn 't exist and more importantly lacking <unk> to roll up their sleeves and pitch in and look around and wonder how can i be useful to my colleagues how can i anticipate a few steps ahead to what my boss might need  a second very important finding from the harvard grant study said that happiness in life comes from love not love of work love of humans our spouse our partner our friends <unk> our family  so childhood needs to teach our kids how to love and they can 't love others if they don 't first love themselves <unk> and they won 't love themselves if we can 't offer them unconditional <unk> <unk> love right  and so instead of being obsessed with grades and scores when <unk> come home from school or we come home from work <unk> we need to close our technology put away our phones and look them in the eye and let them see the joy that fills our faces <unk> when we see our child for the first time in a few hours <unk> and then we have to say  <unk> to hear about the math test not lunch  you have to still take an interest in lunch you gotta say what was great about lunch today  they need to know they matter to us as humans not because of their <unk> <unk> so you 're thinking chores and love that sounds all well and but give me a break the colleges want to see top scores and grades and accolades and awards and i 'm going to tell you sort of  the very biggest brand name schools are asking that of our young adults but here 's the good news  contrary to what the college rankings racket would have us believe  you don 't have to go to <unk> one of the biggest brand name schools to be happy and successful in life happy and successful people went to state school <unk> went to a small college no one has heard of went to community college <unk> <unk> went to a college over here and flunked out  the evidence is in this room is in our communities that this is the truth <unk> and if we could widen our blinders and be willing to look at a few more colleges maybe remove our own egos from the equation  we could accept and embrace this truth and then realize it is hardly the end of the world if our kids don 't go to one of those big brand name schools <unk>  and more importantly if their childhood has not been lived according to a tyrannical checklist then when they get to college <unk> whichever one it is well they 'll have gone there on their own volition <unk>  fueled by their own desire <unk> capable and ready to thrive there  i have to admit something to you i 've got two kids i mentioned sawyer and avery they <unk> and once upon a time <unk> i think i was treating my sawyer and avery like little bonsai trees  that i was going to carefully clip and prune and shape into some perfect form of a human that might just be perfect enough to warrant them admission to one of the most highly selective colleges <unk>  but i 've come to realize after working with thousands of other people 's kids <unk> and raising two kids of my own my kids aren 't bonsai trees <unk> they 're wildflowers of an unknown genus and species  and it 's my job to provide a nourishing environment to strengthen them through chores and to love them so they can love others and <unk> receive love and the college <unk> the major <unk> the career that 's up to them  my job is not to make them become what i would have them become  but to support them in becoming their glorious selves
