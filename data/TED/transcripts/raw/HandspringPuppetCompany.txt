 <unk> here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse basil jones but actually we 're going to start this evolution with a hyena ak the ancestor of the <unk> the hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called faustus in africa a handspring production from one thousand nine <unk> where it had to play draughts with helen of troy this production was directed by south african artist and theater director william kentridge <unk> so it needed a very articulate front paw  but like all puppets it has other attributes bj  one of them is breath <unk> and it kind of breathes ak haa haa haaa bj  breath is really important for us <unk> it 's the kind kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage <unk> it 's the thing that distinguishes the puppet ak oops bj  from an actor  puppets always have to try to be alive it 's their kind of <unk> ur story onstage that desperation to live ak yeah it 's basically a dead object as you can see <unk> and it <unk> lives because you make it an actor struggles to die onstage but a puppet has to struggle to live and in a way that 's a metaphor for life bj  so every moment it 's on the stage <unk> it 's making the struggle so we we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses <unk> actually i prefer to say that it 's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life bj  okay so ak it has ears that move passively when the head goes bj and it has these bulkheads made out of plywood covered with fabric curiously similar <unk> fact to the plywood canoes that adrian 's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop ak in port elizabeth the village outside port elizabeth in south africa bj his mother was a puppeteer  and when we met at art school and fell in love in one thousand nine <unk> i hated puppets i really thought they were so beneath me i wanted to become an avant garde artist and punch and judy was certainly not where i wanted to go  and in fact it took about ten years to discover the bambara bamana puppets of mali in west africa where there 's a fabulous tradition of puppetry  to learn a renewed <unk> or a new respect <unk> persuaded basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company and twenty years later <unk> miraculously  we collaborated with a company from mali the sogolon marionette troupe of bamako  where we made a piece about a tall giraffe it was just called tall horse which was a life sized giraffe bj and here again you see the same structure the bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane <unk> but it 's ultimately the same structure it 's got two people inside <unk> it on stilts which give them the height and somebody in the front who 's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head ak the person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail a bit like the hyena same mechanism just a bit bigger <unk> and he 's controlling the the ear movement bj  <unk> this production was seen by tom morris of the national theatre in london <unk> and just around that time  his mother had said have you seen this this book by michael morpurgo called ' war horse ' ak it 's about a boy who falls in love with a horse the horse is <unk> <unk> sold to the first world war <unk> and he joins up to find his horse bj so tom gave us a call and said  <unk> idea bj but it had to ride it had to have a rider ak it had to have a rider and it had to participate in cavalry charges a play about early 20th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the national theatre in london but they agreed to go along with it for a <unk> who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse <unk> and our next door neighbor katherine  riding on a ladder <unk> the weight is really difficult when it 's up above your head ak  and once we put katherine through that particular brand of hell <unk> we knew that we might be able to make a horse <unk> which could be ridden <unk> so we made a model this is a cardboard model a little bit smaller than the hyena you 'll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there bj and the two manipulators are inside <unk> but we didn 't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator because we couldn 't manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time ak  we started work on the prototype after the model was approved and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated <unk> we had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones <unk> and we had a crate built for it it had to be shipped to london we were going to test drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town and it got to midnight and we hadn 't done that yet bj  so we got a camera <unk>  and we posed the puppet in various <unk> we sent it off to the national theatre <unk> hoping that they believed that we created something that worked ak  a month later we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us bj about forty people ak we were terrified we opened the lid we took the horse out <unk> and it did work it walked and it was able to be ridden <unk> clip of the very first walk of of the prototype this is in the national theatre studio the place where they cook new ideas it had by no means got the green light yet the choreographer toby sedgwick invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse <unk> which was made out of sticks and <unk> and bits of twigs <unk> grew up into the big horse <unk> and nick starr the director of the national theatre <unk> saw that particular moment he was standing next to me he nearly wet himself <unk> and so the show was given the green light and we went back to cape town and redesigned the horse completely here is the plan  and here is our factory in cape <unk> town where we make horses you can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there <unk>  the horses are completely handmade there is very little 20th century technology in them we used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces <unk> but because they have to be light and flexible <unk> and each one of them is different they can 't be <unk> here are some half finished horses ready to be worked in london <unk> and now we would like to introduce you to joey <unk> joey boy you there <unk> like to describe i won 't talk too loud he might get irritated <unk> craig is working the head he has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand <unk> each one of them operates either an ear <unk> separately <unk> or the head up and down but he also controls the head directly by using his hand <unk> the ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse <unk> when they point right back the horse is fearful or angry <unk> depending upon what 's going on in front of him around him <unk> or when he 's more relaxed the head comes down and the ears listen either side  horses ' hearing is very important it 's almost more important than their eyesight <unk>  <unk> what you call the heart position he 's working the leg you see the string tendon from the hyena <unk> the hyena 's front leg <unk>  automatically pulls the hoop up  horses are so unpredictable  the way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it 's a convincing horse action the hind legs have got the same action  bj and mikey also has in his fingers <unk> the ability to move the tail from left to right and up and down with the other hand and together there 's quite a complex possibility <unk> tail expression ak you want to say something about the breathing  bj we had a big challenge with breathing adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that because that 's how a horse <unk> would breathe with an expanded chest but we realized that if that were to be happening you wouldn 't <unk> as an audience see the <unk> so he made a channel in here and the chest moves up and down in that channel so <unk> <unk> really the up and down movement but it feels like breath <unk> and it 's very very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees ak  other emotional stuff <unk> if i were to touch the horse here on his skin  <unk> puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver  you 'll notice of course that the puppet is made out of cane lines and i would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice that i was making a three dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space but of course <unk> it was the cane is light the cane is flexible the cane is durable and the cane is moldable <unk> and so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane <unk> is made out of a see through nylon mesh <unk> which if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike you see the the skeletal structure of it or if you light it from above it becomes more solid <unk> again <unk> that was a practical consideration the guys inside the horse have to be able to see out they have to be able to act along <unk> with their fellow actors in in the production and it 's very much an in the moment activity that they 're engaged in <unk> it 's three heads making one character <unk>  but now we would like you to put joey through some paces <unk> all the way from sunny california we have zem joaquin who 's going to ride the horse <unk> so we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly bj not being able to talk to one another while they 're onstage because the sound that that very large chest makes of the horse the whinnying and the nickering and everything that starts usually with one performer <unk> <unk> carries on with a second person and ends with a third
