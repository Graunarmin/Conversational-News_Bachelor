 <unk> journalist was asking him a question about the news feed <unk> and the journalist was asking him why is this so important  and zuckerberg said a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in africa and i want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like so when i was growing up in a really rural area in maine the internet meant something very different to me <unk> it meant a connection to the world it meant something that would connect us all together <unk> and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society <unk> but there 's this shift in how information is flowing online and it 's invisible <unk>  and if we don 't pay attention to it it could be a real problem <unk>  so i first noticed this in a place i spend a lot of time my facebook page i 'm progressive politically big surprise but i 've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives i like hearing what they 're thinking about <unk> like seeing what they link to i like learning a thing or two <unk> and so i was surprised when i noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my facebook feed <unk>  and what it turned out was going on was that facebook was looking at which links i clicked on and it was noticing that actually i was clicking more on my liberal friends <unk> than on my conservative friends ' links and without consulting me about it it had edited them out they disappeared <unk> so facebook isn 't the only place that 's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web  google 's doing it too  if i search for something and you search for something even right now at the very same time <unk> we may get very different search results <unk> even if you 're logged out one engineer told me there are fifty seven signals that google looks at everything from what kind of computer you 're on to what kind of browser you 're using to where you 're located that it uses to personally tailor your query results think about it for a second <unk> there is no standard <unk> and you know the funny thing about this is that it 's hard to see you can 't see how different your search results are from anyone else 's  but a couple of weeks ago i asked a bunch of friends to google egypt  and to send me screen shots of what they got <unk>  so here 's my friend scott 's screen shot <unk> and here 's my friend daniel 's screen shot  <unk> you don 't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are but when you do read the links it 's really quite remarkable <unk>  daniel didn 't get anything about the protests in egypt at all in his first page of google results <unk> scott 's results were full of them <unk> and this was the big story of the day at that time that 's how different these results are becoming <unk>  so it 's not just google and facebook <unk> this is something that 's sweeping the web there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization yahoo news the biggest news site on the internet is now personalized different people get different things <unk>  huffington post the washington post the new york times all flirting with personalization in various ways and this this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see <unk> but not necessarily what we need to as eric schmidt said  it will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them  so i do think this is a problem <unk> and i think if you take all of these filters together you take all these algorithms you get what i call a filter bubble and your filter bubble is your own personal <unk> unique universe of information that you live in online <unk> and what 's in your filter bubble depends on who you are <unk> and it depends on what you do but the thing is that you don 't decide what gets in and more importantly  you don 't actually see what gets edited out <unk> so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at netflix and they were looking at the netflix queues and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed  which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses they enter the queue they just zip right out  so iron man zips right out and waiting for superman can wait for a really long time  what they discovered was that in our netflix queues there 's this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves you know we all want to be someone who has watched rashomon but right now we want to watch ace ventura for the fourth time  so the best editing gives us a bit of both it gives us a little bit of justin bieber and a little bit of afghanistan <unk> it gives us some information vegetables it gives us some information dessert <unk>  and the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters these personalized filters is that because they 're mainly looking at what you click on first it can throw off that balance <unk> and instead of a <unk> you can end up surrounded by information junk food what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong in a broadcast society this is how the founding mythology goes in a broadcast society <unk>  there were these gatekeepers the editors <unk> and they controlled the flows of information  and along came the internet and it swept them out of the way and it allowed all of us to connect together <unk> and it was awesome <unk> but that 's not <unk> actually what 's happening right now what we 're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones <unk> and the thing is that the algorithms don 't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us if they 're going to decide what we get to <unk> see and what we don 't get to see then we need to make sure that they 're not just keyed to relevance  we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important this is what ted does other points of view <unk>  and the thing is we 've actually been here before as a society <unk>  <unk> and fifteen it 's not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities <unk> then people noticed that they were doing something really important  that in fact you couldn 't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn 't get a good flow of information  that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter and then journalistic ethics developed <unk> it wasn 't perfect <unk> but it got us through the last century <unk> and so now we 're kind of back in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen on the web <unk> and we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they 're writing i know that there are a lot of people here from facebook and from google larry and <unk> people who have helped build the web as <unk> and i 'm grateful for that but we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life a sense of civic responsibility  we need you to make sure that they 're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters <unk>  and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn 't because i think we really need the internet to be <unk> that thing that we all dreamed of it being we need it to connect us all together <unk> we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives  and it 's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one
