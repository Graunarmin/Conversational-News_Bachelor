 <unk> want to alarm anybody in this room but it 's just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar  also the person to your left is a liar <unk> also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar <unk> we 're all liars what i 'm going to do today is i 'm going to show you what the research says about why we 're all liars how you can become a liespotter and why you might want to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking and ultimately to trust building  now speaking of trust ever since i <unk> i can 't even get a coffee date at starbucks  my husband 's like honey deception <unk> maybe you could have focused on cooking how about french cooking  so before i get started what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to clarify my goal for you  which is not to teach a game of gotcha <unk> liespotters aren 't those nitpicky kids those kids in the back of the room <unk> that are shouting gotcha gotcha your eyebrow twitched  you flared your nostril i watch that tv show ' lie to me ' i know you 're lying no  liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge of how to spot deception <unk> they use it to get to the truth <unk>  and they do what mature leaders do everyday they have difficult conversations with difficult people <unk> sometimes during very difficult times <unk>  and they start up that path by accepting a core proposition and that proposition is the following <unk> lying is a cooperative act  think about it a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie <unk>  so i know it may sound like tough love but look if at some point you got lied to it 's because you agreed to get lied to truth number one about lying lying 's a cooperative act now <unk> not all lies are harmful <unk> sometimes we 're willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity <unk> maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret secret <unk> we say nice song  honey you don 't look fat in that no  or we say <unk> favorite of the digiratti you know i just fished that email out of my spam folder <unk> so sorry  but there are times when we are are unwilling participants in deception and that can have dramatic costs for us  last year saw nine hundred and ninety seven billion dollars in corporate fraud alone in the united states  that 's an eyelash under a trillion dollars that 's seven percent of revenues deception can cost billions think enron <unk> madoff the mortgage <unk> or in the case of double agents and traitors like robert hanssen or aldrich ames lies can betray our country they can compromise our security <unk>  they can undermine democracy they can cause the deaths of those that defend us deception is actually serious business  this con man <unk> henry oberlander he was such an effective con man <unk> british authorities say he could have undermined the entire banking system of the western <unk> and you can 't find this guy on google you can 't find him anywhere he was interviewed once and he said the following he said look i 've got one rule and this was henry 's rule <unk> he said look  everyone is willing to give you something they 're ready to give you something for whatever it is they 're hungry for  and that 's the crux of it if you don 't want to be deceived you have to know what is it that you 're hungry for  and we all kind of hate to admit it we wish we were better husbands better wives smarter more powerful taller richer the list goes on  lying is an attempt to bridge that gap  to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were how we wish we could be with what we 're really like <unk>  and boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies on a given day <unk> studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from ten to two hundred times now granted many of those are white lies <unk>  but in another <unk> study it showed that strangers lied three times within the first ten minutes of meeting each other now when we first hear this data <unk> we recoil we can 't believe how prevalent lying is we 're essentially against lying <unk>  but if you look more closely the plot actually thickens  we lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers <unk>  extroverts lie more than introverts <unk> men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people women lie more to protect other people  if you 're an average married couple  you 're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every ten interactions now you may think that 's bad if you 're unmarried that number drops to three  lying 's complex <unk> it 's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives we 're deeply <unk> ambivalent about the truth <unk> we parse it out on an as needed basis sometimes for very very good reasons other times just because we don 't understand the gaps in our lives <unk>  that 's truth number two about lying <unk> we 're against lying <unk>  but we 're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries it 's as old as breathing it 's part of our culture it 's part of our history  think dante shakespeare <unk> the bible news of the world  lying has evolutionary value to us as a species researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species the larger the neocortex the more likely it is to be deceptive <unk>  now you might remember koko does anybody remember koko the gorilla who was taught sign language koko was taught to communicate via sign language here 's koko with her kitten it 's her cute little fluffy pet kitten <unk>  koko once blamed her pet kitten for ripping a sink out of the wall  laughter we 're hardwired to become leaders of the pack it 's starts really really early <unk> how early <unk>  well babies will fake a cry <unk> pause <unk> wait to see who 's coming and then go right back <unk> by the time you enter college you 're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions by the time we enter this work world and we 're breadwinners we enter a world that is just cluttered with spam <unk> ponzi schemers a deception epidemic in short what one author calls a <unk> society <unk> it 's been very confusing for a long time now  what do you do <unk>  well there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass trained liespotters get to the truth ninety percent of the time the rest <unk> of us we 're only fifty four percent accurate <unk>  why is it so easy to learn  there are good liars and bad liars there are no real original liars we all make the same mistakes <unk> we all use the same techniques  so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to show you two patterns of deception and then we 're going to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves we 're going to start with speech <unk> not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky i never told anybody to lie not a single time never <unk> and these allegations are false and i need to go back to work for the american people <unk> denial <unk> studies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather than informal language <unk> we also heard distancing language that woman  we know that liars will unconsciously distance themselves from their subject <unk>  using language as their tool  now if bill clinton had said well to <unk> or richard nixon 's favorite in all candor he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language as it 's called qualifying language like that further discredits the subject <unk>  now if he had repeated the question in its entirety or if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail and we 're all really glad he didn 't do that he would have further discredited himself <unk> freud had it right freud said look there 's much more to it than speech <unk> keep a secret <unk> if his lips are silent <unk>  he chatters with his fingertips and we all do it no matter how powerful you are we all chatter with our fingertips <unk>  i 'm going to show you dominique strauss kahn with obama who 's chattering with his fingertips  now this brings us to our next pattern which is body language <unk> body language <unk> here 's what you 've got to do you 've really got to just throw your assumptions out the door let the science temper your knowledge a little bit <unk> because we think liars fidget all the time well guess what they 're known to freeze their upper bodies when they 're lying <unk> we think liars won 't look you in the eyes well guess what they look you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth <unk> we think warmth and smiles convey honesty sincerity <unk> a trained liespotter can spot a fake smile a mile away can you all spot the fake smile here you can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks  but the real smile 's in the eyes <unk> the crow 's feet of the eyes they cannot be consciously contracted especially if you overdid the botox don 't overdo <unk> nobody will think you 're honest  now we 're going to look at the hot spots can you tell what 's happening in a conversation can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone 's words and someone 's actions <unk>  now i know it seems really obvious but when you 're having a conversation with someone you suspect of deception <unk>  attitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators an honest person is going to be cooperative they 're going to show they 're on your side <unk> they 're going to be enthusiastic they 're going to be willing and <unk> helpful to getting you to the truth <unk>  they 're going to be willing to brainstorm name suspects <unk> provide details they 're going to say hey maybe it was those guys in payroll that forged those checks they 're going to be infuriated if they sense they 're wrongly accused throughout the entire course of the interview not just in flashes they 'll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview <unk>  and if you ask someone honest what should happen to whomever did forge those checks an honest <unk> person is much more likely to recommend strict rather than lenient punishment <unk>  now let 's say you 're having that exact same conversation with someone deceptive that person may be withdrawn look down lower their voice pause be kind of herky jerky  ask a deceptive person to tell their story they 're going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places  and then they 're going to tell their story in <unk> strict chronological order and what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways over the course of several hours they will ask that person to tell that story backwards <unk> and then they 'll watch them squirm and track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive <unk> <unk> tells why do they do that well <unk> we all do the same thing <unk> we rehearse our words but we rarely rehearse our gestures we say yes we shake our heads <unk> convincing stories we slightly shrug our shoulders we commit terrible crimes and we smile at the delight in getting away with it now that smile is known in the trade as duping delight and we 're going to see that in several videos moving forward but we 're going to start for those of you who don 't know him this is presidential candidate john edwards who shocked america by fathering a child out of wedlock we 're going to see him talk about getting a paternity test see <unk> now if you can spot him saying yes while shaking his head no slightly shrugging his shoulders john edwards i 'd be happy to participate in one i know that it 's not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events so i know it 's not possible happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen interviewer are you going to do that soon <unk> those head shakes are much easier to spot once you know to look for them <unk> there are going to be times when someone makes one expression while masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash <unk> murderers are known to leak sadness your new joint venture partner might shake your hand celebrate go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger <unk>  and we 're not all going to become facial expression <unk> experts overnight here <unk> but there 's one i can teach you that 's very dangerous and it 's easy to learn <unk> and that 's the expression of contempt <unk>  now with anger you 've got two people on an even playing field <unk> it 's still somewhat of a healthy relationship but when anger turns to contempt <unk> you 've been dismissed <unk>  it 's associated with moral superiority and for that reason it 's very <unk> hard to recover from here 's what it looks like <unk>  it 's marked by one lip corner pulled up and in it 's the only asymmetrical expression and in the presence of contempt <unk>  whether or not deception follows and it doesn 't always follow look the other way go the other direction reconsider the deal say no thank you i 'm not coming up for just one more nightcap thank you  science has surfaced many many more indicators <unk> we know for example we know liars <unk> will shift their blink rate point their feet towards an exit <unk>  they will take barrier objects and put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them they 'll alter their vocal tone often making their vocal tone much lower  now here 's the deal <unk>  these behaviors are just behaviors they 're not proof of deception <unk> they 're red flags we 're human beings we make deceptive <unk> flailing gestures all over the place all day long they don 't mean anything in and of themselves but when you see clusters of them that 's your signal look listen probe <unk> ask some hard questions get out of that very comfortable mode of knowing  walk into curiosity mode ask more questions  have a little dignity <unk> treat the person you 're talking to with rapport don 't try to be like those folks on law & order and those other tv shows that pummel their subjects into submission don 't be too aggressive it doesn 't work  now we 've talked a little bit about how to talk to someone who 's lying and how to spot a lie and as i promised we 're now going to look at what the truth looks like <unk>  but i 'm going to show you two videos two mothers one is lying one is telling the truth and these were surfaced by researcher david matsumoto in california and i think they 're an excellent example of what the truth looks like <unk> this mother diane downs <unk>  shot her kids at close range <unk> drove them to the hospital while they bled all over the car claimed a <unk> scraggy haired stranger did it and you 'll see when you see the video <unk> she can 't even pretend to be an agonizing mother what you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes and her very very cool demeanor and if you look closely you 'll see duping delight <unk> throughout this video diane downs at night when i close my eyes i can see christie reaching her hand out to me while i 'm driving and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth <unk> and that maybe it 'll fade too with time but i don 't think so that bothers me the most  now i 'm going to show you a video of an actual <unk> grieving mother <unk> erin runnion confronting her daughter 's murderer and torturer in court  here you 're going to see no false emotion just the authentic expression of a mother 's agony erin runnion  i wrote this statement on the third anniversary of the night you took my baby <unk> and you hurt her and you crushed her you terrified her until her heart stopped and she fought <unk> and i know she you but i know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes <unk> and you still wanted to kill her and i don 't understand it <unk> and i never will pm  okay there 's no doubting the veracity of those emotions <unk> now the technology around what the truth looks like is progressing <unk> the science of it <unk> we know for example that we now have specialized eye trackers and infrared brain scans mri 's that can decode the signals that our bodies send out when we 're trying to be deceptive <unk> and these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit <unk>  and they will prove incredibly useful some day <unk>  but you 've got to ask yourself in the meantime who do you want on your side of the meeting someone who 's trained in getting to the truth or some guy who 's going to drag a <unk> the door <unk> liespotters rely on human tools <unk> they know as someone once said character 's who you are in the dark  and what 's kind of interesting is that today we have so little darkness our world is lit up twenty four hours a day it 's transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their <unk> lives in public it 's a much more noisy world so one challenge we have is to remember  oversharing <unk> that 's not honesty  our manic tweeting and texting can blind us to the fact that the subtleties of human decency character integrity that 's still what matters that 's <unk> what 's going to matter so in this much noisier world it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code  when you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking listening you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie  you start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit because you signal to everyone around you you say hey <unk> my <unk> going to be an honest one my world is going to be one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized and marginalized and when you do that  the ground around you starts to shift just a little bit <unk> and that 's the truth
