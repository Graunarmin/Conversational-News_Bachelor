 <unk> i 'm not at all a cook <unk> so don 't fear this is not going to be a cooking demonstration <unk> but i do want to talk to you about something that i think is dear to all of us and that is bread something which is as simple <unk> as our basic <unk> most fundamental human staple <unk> and i think few of us spend the day without eating bread in some form <unk> unless you 're on one of these californian <unk> low carb diets  bread is standard bread is not only standard in the western diet as i will show to you it is actually the mainstay of modern life <unk> so i 'm going to bake bread <unk> in the meantime i 'm also talking to you so my life is going to be complicated <unk> bear with me first of all a little bit of audience participation i have two loaves of bread here <unk>  one is a supermarket standard white bread pre packaged which i 'm told is called a wonderbread  laughter i didn 't know this word until i arrived <unk> and this <unk> loaf of bread here we go i want to see a show of hands who prefers the whole meal bread <unk>  okay let me do this differently is anybody preferring the wonderbread at all i have two tentative male hands <unk> this so and i think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity <unk> it 's about a traditional way of living a way that is perhaps more real more honest this is an image from tuscany where we feel agriculture is still <unk> and this is about good taste good traditions <unk> why do we have this image <unk> why do we feel that this is more true than than this <unk>  well i think it has a lot to do with our history <unk> in the ten thousand years since agriculture evolved most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists or they <unk> <unk> were closely related to food production <unk> and we have this mythical image of how life was in rural areas in the past art has helped us to maintain that kind of image  it was a mythical past of course the reality is quite different these poor farmers working the land by hand or with their animals had yield levels <unk> <unk> that are comparable to the poorest farmers today in west africa <unk> but we have somehow in the course of the last few <unk> centuries or even decades <unk> started to cultivate an image of a mythical rural agricultural past it was only two hundred years ago that we had the advent of the industrial revolution and while i 'm starting to make some bread for you here <unk>  it 's very important to understand what that revolution <unk> and it actually drove up our yields and even sort of horrible things like picking beans by hand can now be done automatically  all that is is a real <unk> great improvement as we shall see of course we also particularly in the last decade  <unk> the world in a dense chain of supermarkets in a chain of global trade <unk>  and it means that you now eat products which can come from all around the world that is the reality of our modern life  now you may prefer this loaf of bread excuse my hands but this is how it is but actually the <unk> is this white wonder loaf and don 't despise the white bread because it really i think symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become plentiful and affordable to all <unk> and that is a feat that we are not really conscious of that much but it has changed the <unk> this tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways and has a lot of problems has changed the world <unk>  so what is happening <unk> well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics  with the advent of the industrial revolution with modernization of agriculture in the last few decades since the <unk> world population in the meantime has has doubled that means that we have now more food available than ever before in human history <unk> and that is the result directly <unk> of being so successful at increasing the scale and volume of our production <unk>  <unk> what happened to our bread in the meantime as food became plentiful here <unk> it also meant that we were able to decrease the number of people working in agriculture to something like on average in the high income countries five percent or less of of the population in the u s only one percent of the people <unk> <unk> are actually farmers and it frees us all up to do other things to sit at ted meetings and not to worry about our food that is historically a really unique situation <unk> never before has the responsibility to feed the world been in the hands of so few people <unk> and never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact  <unk> and as it became cheaper bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things we added in more sugar <unk> we add in raisins and oil and milk and all kinds of things to make bread from a simple food into kind of a support for calories <unk>  and today bread now is associated with obesity which is very strange <unk> it is the basic most fundamental food that we 've had in the last ten thousand years wheat is the most important crop the first crop we domesticated and the most important crop we still grow <unk> <unk> today <unk> but this is now this strange concoction of high calories <unk>  <unk> find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava so bread has become from a main staple  a source of calories associated with obesity and also a source of modernity of modern life <unk>  and the whiter the bread in many countries the better it is so this is the story of bread as we know it now but of course the price of <unk> mass production has been that we moved <unk> large scale and large scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes <unk> destruction of biodiversity still a lonely emu here in the brazilian cerrado soybean fields the costs have been tremendous water pollution all the things you know about destruction of our <unk> what we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about <unk> and this is where i have to query all of you how many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals <unk> how many of you actually can make a bread in this way without starting with a bread machine or just which again evolutionarily speaking is very strange <unk>  in fact not many of you know that our bread of course was not a european invention it was invented by farmers in iraq and syria in particular the tiny spike on the left to the center is actually the forefather of wheat this is where it all comes from and where these farmers who actually ten thousand years ago <unk> put us on the road of bread now it is not surprising that with this massification and large scale production there is a counter movement that emerged very much also here in california <unk> let 's go back to this let 's go back to traditional farming let 's go back to small scale to farmers ' markets small bakeries <unk> don 't we all agree <unk> i certainly agree <unk> i would love to go back to tuscany to this kind of traditional setting gastronomy <unk> good food  but this is a fallacy <unk> and the fallacy comes from idealizing a past that we have forgotten about  if we do this if we want to stay with traditional small scale farming we are going actually to relegate these poor farmers and their husbands among whom i have lived for many <unk> years working without electricity and water to try to improve their food production we relegate them to poverty  what they want are implements to increase their production something to fertilize the soil something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market <unk>  we cannot just think that <unk> is the solution to the world food problem <unk> it 's a luxury solution for us who can afford it if you want to afford it <unk> in fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this if we say just small scale production as is the tendency here to go back to local food means that a poor man <unk> <unk> like hans rosling cannot even eat oranges anymore because in scandinavia we don 't have oranges  <unk> relegate the urban poor to starvation <unk> so we must find other solutions  one of our problems is that world food production needs to increase very rapidly doubling by about two thousand and thirty  the main driver of that is actually meat <unk> and meat consumption in southeast asia and china in particular is what <unk> need for animal protein is going to continue we can discuss alternatives in another talk perhaps one day <unk> but this is our driving force <unk> so what can we do  can we find a solution to produce more  yes <unk>  but we need mechanization <unk> and i 'm making a real plea here <unk>  i feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice <unk> one hundred and fifty thousand times just to plant a crop and weed it you cannot ask people to work under these conditions we need clever low key mechanization that avoids the problems of the large scale mechanization that we 've had <unk>  so what can we do we must feed three billion people <unk> in cities we will not do that through small farmers ' markets because these people have no small farmers ' markets at their disposal  they have low incomes <unk> and they benefit from cheap <unk> affordable <unk> safe and diverse food that 's what we must aim for in the next twenty to thirty years <unk> but yes <unk> <unk> there are some solutions <unk> and let me just do one simple conceptual thing if i plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale what you see is <unk> that we 've started in the left hand corner with traditional agriculture which was sort of <unk> we 've moved towards <unk> large scale and very high control what i want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional <unk> <unk> scale not just in terms of the scale of the fields but in terms of the entire food network that 's where we should move <unk> and the ultimate may be but it doesn 't apply to cereals that we have entirely closed ecosystems the horticultural systems right at the top left hand corner <unk>  so we need to think differently about agriculture science agriculture science for most people and there are not many farmers among you here has this name of being bad of being about pollution about large scale about the destruction of the <unk> environment that is not necessary we need more science and not less <unk> and we need good science <unk> so what kind of science can we have <unk> well first of all i think we can do <unk> <unk> much better on the existing technologies use biotechnology where where useful particularly in pest and disease resistance  <unk> with a resolution of half an inch we have much cleverer irrigation we do not need to spill the water if we don 't want to <unk>  and we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of we need to think that land is multi functional it has different functions there are different ways in which we must use it for residential for nature for agriculture purposes <unk> and we also need to re examine livestock  go regional and go to urban food systems i want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements <unk> i want to have horticulture and greenhouses <unk> <unk> on top of residential areas <unk> and i want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses and from the fermentation of crops to heat our residential areas  <unk> using biological agriculture but we can do a lot more  and the main thing that i would really ask all of you as you go back to your countries or as you stay here  ask your government for an integrated food policy food is as important as energy as security as the environment <unk> everything is linked <unk> we can do that in fact in a densely populated country like the river delta where i live in the netherlands we have combined these functions <unk> so this is not science fiction we can combine <unk> <unk> things even in a social sense of making the rural areas more accessible to people to house for example the chronically sick there is all kinds of things we can do  <unk> about your own food chain talk to farmers when was the last time you went to a farm and talked to a farmer <unk> talk to people in restaurants understand where you are in the food chain where your food <unk> <unk> comes from understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events <unk> and that frees you up to do other things <unk>  <unk> that there are also many people who are still in this situation <unk> who are still struggling for their daily food <unk>  and the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution  is really not morally justified we need to help to lift them out of poverty <unk> we need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive never before as i said has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few and never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap <unk>  and i think there is nobody else who has expressed better to me the idea that food in the end <unk> in our own <unk> it 's not about nutrients and calories <unk> it 's about sharing <unk> it 's about honesty it 's about identity who said this so beautifully was mahatma gandhi seventy five <unk> years ago when he spoke about bread he did not speak about rice <unk> in india <unk> he said to those who have to go without two meals a day <unk> god can only appear as bread <unk> evolutionarily speaking is
