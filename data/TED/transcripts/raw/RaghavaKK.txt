 <unk> years ago my grandfather a young man walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that  and he fell hopelessly in love with the woman he saw on the silver screen <unk> none other than mae west <unk> heartthrob of the ' 30s  and he could never forget her in fact when he had his daughter many years later  he wanted to name her after mae west but can you imagine an indian child name mae west  the indian family said <unk> no way so when my twin brother kaesava was born  he decided to tinker with the spelling of keshava <unk> so he changed kaesava 's spelling <unk>  now kaesava had a baby boy called rehan a couple of weeks ago <unk> he decided to spell or rather misspell raehan with an a e  you know my grandfather died many years ago when i was little <unk> but his love for mae west lives on as a misspelling in the dna of his progeny  that for me is <unk> legacy you know as for me my wife and i have our own crazy legacy project <unk>  we actually sit every few years <unk> argue <unk> disagree <unk> fight <unk> and actually come up with our very own <unk> 200 year plan  our friends think we 're mad our parents think we 're cuckoo <unk> because you know we both come from families that <unk> really look up to humility and wisdom <unk> but we both like to live larger than life i believe in the concept of a raja yogi be a dude <unk> before you can become an ascetic this is me being a rock star even if it 's in my own house <unk>  <unk> what do we mean by beyond ourselves <unk>  well two hundred years we calculated is at the end of our direct contact with the world there 's nobody i 'll meet in my life will ever live beyond two hundred years  so we thought that 's a perfect place where we should situate our plan and let our imagination take flight <unk> you know i never really believed in legacy what am i going to leave behind i 'm an artist <unk> i made a cartoon about nine eleven it caused so much trouble for me i was so upset <unk>  you know <unk> a cartoon that was meant to be a cartoon of the week ended up staying so much longer <unk> now i 'm in the business of creating art that will definitely even outlive me <unk> and i think about what i want to leave behind through those paintings <unk> <unk> the nine eleven cartoon upset me so much that i decided i 'll never cartoon again <unk> i said i 'm never going to make any honest public commentary again <unk>  but of course i continued creating artwork that was honest and raw <unk>  because i forgot about how people reacted to my work you know sometimes forgetting is so important to remain idealistic <unk>  perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings <unk> most important things in my 200 year plan that netra and i write is what to forget about ourselves you know we carry so much baggage from our parents from our society from so many people fears <unk> insecurities and our 200 year plan really lists all our childhood problems that we have to expire <unk> we actually put an expiry date on all our childhood problems  the latest date i put was i said <unk> i am going to expire my fear of my leftist feminist mother in law  and this today is the date  laughs she 's watching  you know <unk> i really make decisions all the time about how i want to remember myself and that 's the most important <unk> kind of decisions i make  and this directly translates into my paintings <unk>  but like my friends <unk> i can do that really well on facebook pinterest twitter flickr <unk> youtube name it i 'm on it  i 've started outsourcing my memory to the digital world <unk> you know <unk> but that comes with a problem <unk> it 's so easy to think of technology <unk> as a metaphor for memory <unk> but our brains are not perfect storage devices like technology we only remember what we want to at least i do <unk>  and i rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory <unk>  you know <unk> and if technology is not a metaphor for memory what is it  netra and i use our technology as a tool in our <unk> that is a picture of my mother <unk> and she recently got a facebook account <unk> you know where this is going <unk>  and i 've been very supportive until this picture shows up on my facebook page  and i actually untagged myself first then i picked up the phone i said mom you will never put a picture of me in a bikini <unk> you just don 't understand maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves <unk>  maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives <unk>  you know <unk> whether you agree with  you know legacy or not we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time so netra and i really wanted to use our <unk> digital legacy <unk> and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future  how you may ask  when i think of the future <unk> i never see myself moving forward in time i actually see time moving backward towards me  i can actually visualize my future approaching <unk> i can dodge what i don 't want and pull in what i want like a video game obstacle course <unk> and i 've gotten better and better at doing this even when i make a painting <unk> i actually imagine i 'm behind the painting it already exists and someone 's looking at it <unk>  and i see whether they 're feeling it from their gut are they feeling it from their heart or is it just a cerebral thing and it really informs my <unk> even when i do an art show i really think about what should people walk away with i remember when i was nineteen i did <unk>  i wanted to do my first art exhibition <unk> and i wanted the whole world to know about it i didn 't know ted then <unk>  but what i did was i closed my eyes tight and i started dreaming <unk>  i could imagine people coming in dressed up looking beautiful my paintings with all the light  and in my visualization i actually saw a very famous launching my show giving credibility to me <unk>  and i woke up from my visualization and i said <unk> who was that i couldn 't tell if it was shabana azmi or rekha two very famous indian actresses like the meryl streeps of india  as it turned out <unk> next morning i wrote a letter to both of them <unk> and <unk> and shabana azmi replied <unk> and came and launched my very first show twelve years ago <unk> and what a bang it started my career with <unk>  you know <unk> when we think of time in this way <unk> we can curate not only the future but also the past this is a picture of my family and that is netra my wife she 's the co creator of my <unk> netra 's a high school history teacher <unk> i love netra <unk> but i hate history <unk>  i keep saying nets <unk> you live in the past while i 'll create the future and when i 'm done you can study about it  she gave me an indulgent smile <unk> and as punishment she said tomorrow i 'm teaching a class on indian history <unk> and you are sitting in it and i 'm grading you she started by giving students primary source documents from india <unk> pakistan from britain and i said wow  then she asked them to separate fact from bias <unk> as an imaging tool  i was so inspired <unk> i went and created my own version of indian history <unk> i actually included stories from my grandmother she used to work for the telephone exchange <unk> and she used to actually overhear conversations between nehru and edwina mountbatten <unk>  and she used to hear all kinds of things she shouldn 't have <unk> i include things like that this is my version of indian history <unk> you know <unk>  if this is so it occurred to me that maybe just maybe the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity <unk> go tell facebook to figure that out <unk> netra and i don 't write <unk> for someone else to come and execute it in one hundred and fifty years imagine receiving a parcel saying  from the past okay now you 're supposed to spend the rest of your life doing all of this no we actually write it only to set our attitudes right <unk>  you know i used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy  education is great it really teaches us who we are and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world <unk> but it 's really my creativity that 's taught me that i can be much more than what my education told me i am  i 'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have it lets us create who we are  and curate what is to come  i like to think thank you i like to think of myself as a storyteller where my past <unk> my future are only stories my stories <unk> waiting to be told and retold  i hope all of you one day get a chance to share and write your own 200 year story thank you so much
