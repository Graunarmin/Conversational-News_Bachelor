 <unk> last few years i 've been had the opportunity to do this closing conference  <unk> about eight years ago <unk> billy graham opened for me and i thought that there was i thought that there was absolutely no way in hell to top that but i just wanted to say and i mean this without irony i think i can speak for everybody in the audience when i say that i wish to god that you were the president of the united states  ok <unk> this is the title of my talk today  i just want to give you a quick overview <unk> first of all please remember i 'm completely politically correct and i mean everything with <unk> if any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy <unk> now is the time to check your blackberry  just to review this is my tedtalk  we 're going to do some jokes some gags <unk> some little skits and then we 're going to talk about the l1 point  <unk> one of the questions i ask myself is was this the most distressing ted ever <unk>  let 's try and sum things up shall we  images of limb regeneration and faces filled with smallpox twenty one percent of the conference  mentions of polar bears drowning four percent <unk> images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu <unk> this is the most distressing ted ever i 've been working with neil gershenfeld on next year 's ted bag <unk> and if the if the conference is anywhere near this distressing then we 're going to have a scream bag next year  it 's going to be a <unk> cradle to cradle scream bag of course so you 're going to be able to go like this <unk> back at ted university this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop sun chips so robert wright i don 't know i felt like if there was anyone that helen needed to give antidepressants to it might have been him  i want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels  he was talking about morality economy class morality is <unk> we want to bomb you back to the stone age <unk> business class morality is <unk> don 't bomb japan they built my car and first class morality is don 't bomb mexico they clean my house yes it is politically incorrect <unk> i wanted to show you guys i wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you as a completely natural user interface and you can you can use really natural hand gestures to like go like this  now we had a harvard professor here she was from harvard i just wanted to mention and and she was actually <unk> of course there 's the gravity brain there 's the weak brain <unk> and then there 's my weak brain which is too too absolutely too weak to understand what the fuck she was talking about  now  one of the things that is very important to me is to try and figure out what on earth am i here <unk> for and that 's why i went out and i picked up a <unk> best selling business book you know it basically uses as its central premise greek mythology <unk> and it 's by a guy named pastor rick warren <unk> and it 's called the porpoise driven life  and rick is as <unk> which i thought was kind of appropriate in a certain way and now we 're going to have kind of a little more visualization about rick warren  ok <unk> the scales here are religiosity religiosity from zero percent or atheist to one hundred percent bible literally true <unk>  and then this is books sold the logarithmic scale <unk> hundred thousand three million thirty million three hundred million <unk> ok now they 're duking it out now they 're duking it out and rick warren 's kind of pulling ahead kind of pulling ahead <unk> yup <unk> and his installed base is getting a little bigger  but darwin 's dangerous idea is coming back  <unk> one of the things that 's very important is nicholas negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per i 'm sorry <unk> about one laptop per child <unk>  now let 's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device i 'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters and then i 'll show it to you in person first of all it needs to be small it needs to be flat so it 's transportable lightweight <unk>  portable uses very very little power <unk> very very high resolution has to be visible in bright daylight will work anywhere and broadly applicable across <unk> many platforms now we 've actually done some research neil gershenfeld and the fab labs went out into the market  they did some research we came back and we think we have the perfect prototype of what the students in the field are actually actually asking for and here it is  <unk> i bought this device from clifford stoll for about nine hundred bucks  and he and his team of junior high school students were doing real science <unk> so we 're trying to check and trying to douse here and see who uses marijuana  see who uses marijuana <unk> only if we open enough locker doors  laughter ok <unk>  now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness we had dr larry brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox  i wanted to show you the stages of smallpox <unk> we start  this is day one <unk> day three she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder <unk> day three <unk> day four  day five and day six  now the good news is because i 'm a trained medical professional i know that even though she 'll be scarred for life she 's going to make a full recovery <unk> now the good news about architects for humanity is they 're really kind of the most amazing group <unk>  they 've been sponsoring a design competition to come up with innovative medical housing solutions clinic solutions  in africa <unk> and they 've had a design competition  now the wonderful thing is larry brilliant was just appointed the head of the google foundation and so he decided that he would support <unk> he would support cameron 's work and the way he decided to support that work was by shipping over fifty thousand shipping containers of google snacks  laughter so i want to show you some prototypes  the u n you know they took twenty years just <unk> a flap to a tent <unk> but i think we have some more exciting things  this is a home made entirely out of fruit roll ups  <unk> those roll up cookies coated with white chocolate and the really wonderful thing about this is when you 're done well but the thing that i 'm really really excited about is this incredible <unk> granola house  and the granola house has a special sun chip roof to collect water and recycle it and it 's well on this side it has regular sour patch kids and gummy bears to let in the light  but on this side it has sugary gummy bears to diffuse the light more slightly and we we wanted <unk> to show you what this might look like in situ <unk> what 's your favorite singing group <unk>  could you say that again what 's your favorite singing group ok <unk> one more time i 'm just going to give you a little help your favorite singing group it 's diana ross and the audience supremes tom exactly could we have the sound up on the laptop please <unk> now it 's a little hard to hear the whole message so i wanted to  so i wanted to help you a little bit <unk> we 've talked a lot about global warming but you know as jill said it sounds kind of nice good <unk> weather in the wintertime and new york city <unk>  and as jay walker pointed out that is just not scary enough <unk> <unk>  so al i actually think i 'm rather good at branding <unk> so i 've tried to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to replace global warming  so we started with babel fish  we put in global warming and then we decided that we 'd change it from english to dutch into het globale verwarmen from dutch to <unk> which is <unk> we 're totally fucked  now i don 't know about you but michael shermer talked about the willingness for human beings evolutionarily they 're designed <unk> <unk> to see patterns in things for example in cheese sandwiches now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the virgin mary i tried to make it a little bit clearer  is it the virgin mary <unk> or is it mena trott <unk>  so i talked to josh prince ramus about the convention center and the conferences it 's getting awfully big it 's getting just a little bit too big it 's bursting at the seams here a little bit so we tried to come up with a program how we could remake this structure to better accommodate ted <unk> so first of all we decided  that we needed about one third bookstore one third google cafe about twenty percent registration eighty percent luxury hotel about five percent for restrooms <unk> and then of course we wanted to have the simulcast lounge the lobby and the steinbeck forum now let me show you how that literally translated into the design program <unk> as you say the ocean level is going to rise twenty feet and flood the hell out of the convention center so we 're going to build this new building on stilts <unk> so we build this building on stilts  then up here  is where we 're going to put the new steinbeck auditorium and the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is it 's going to be shaped in a spiral that 's <unk> 're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there  and finally we 're going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top  now i don 't know about you but sometimes i have these images in my head of separated at birth i don 't know about you but when i see aubrey de grey <unk> i immediately go <unk> we 've heard of course that we 're all soldiers here so what i 'd really really like you to do now is <unk> pick up your white piece of paper <unk> does everybody have their white piece of paper <unk>  and i want you to get out a pen <unk> and i want you to write a terrorist note if we put up the elmo for a moment if we put up the elmo then <unk> give you a model that you can work from ok  and then then i want you to fold that note into a paper airplane <unk>  and once you 've folded it into a paper airplane i want you to take some anthrax  and i want you to put that in the paper airplane <unk> and then i want you to throw it on jim young <unk> luckily i was the recipient of the ted prize this year <unk> and i wanted to see i want to dedicate this film to my father homer <unk> ok <unk>  now this film isn 't really hard enough <unk> so i wanted to <unk> going to try and do this while reciting pi <unk> we cue the music please <unk> now i wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit back <unk> <unk> you can see that the mountain range of brokeback mountain was covered in one hundred and fifty one inches of snow pack parenthetically over there on the slopes i did want to show you that black men ski  but over the years  ten years later the snow packs eroded and if you notice the trees have started turning yellow <unk> the water level of the lake has started drying up a few years later there 's no snow left at all and all the trees have turned brown  this year <unk> unfortunately the lakebed 's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed  and i fear if we do nothing for our planet in twenty years it 's going to look like this <unk> vice president i wish i knew how to quit you
