 <unk> years old i left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding teaching  i went to teach seventh graders math in the new york city public schools <unk> and like any teacher <unk> i made <unk> quizzes and tests i gave out homework assignments when the work came back <unk> i calculated grades  what struck me was that iq was not the only difference between my best and my worst students <unk>  some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric iq scores <unk> some of my smartest kids weren 't doing so well <unk> and that got me <unk> thinking the kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math sure they 're hard <unk> ratios decimals the area of a parallelogram <unk>  but these concepts are not impossible  and i was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and <unk> after several more years of teaching <unk>  i came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective <unk> from a psychological perspective  in education the one thing we know how to measure best is iq  but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability <unk> to learn quickly and easily <unk>  so i left the classroom and i went to graduate school to become a psychologist <unk>  i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings  and in every study my question was who is successful here and why  my research <unk> team and i went to west point military academy we tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out  we went to the national spelling bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition  we studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods <unk> asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year  and of those who will be the most effective at improving <unk> learning outcomes for their students we partnered with private companies asking which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs <unk> and who 's going to earn the most money  in all those very different contexts one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success <unk> and it wasn 't social intelligence it wasn 't <unk> it was grit  grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals grit is having stamina  grit is sticking with your future day in day out not just for the week not just for the month <unk> but for years  and working really hard to make that future a reality  grit is living life like it 's a <unk> marathon not a sprint  a few years ago <unk> i started studying grit in the chicago public schools <unk>  i asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires <unk> and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate <unk>  turns out that grittier kids were significantly <unk> more likely to graduate  even when i matched them on every characteristic i could measure things like family income <unk> standardized achievement test scores <unk>  even how safe kids felt when they were at school  so it 's not just at west point or the national spelling bee that grit matters  it 's also in school especially for kids at risk for dropping out  to me the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know how little science <unk> knows about building it  every day parents and teachers ask me how do i build grit in kids what do i do to teach kids a solid work ethic  how do i keep them motivated for the long run  the honest answer is i don 't know  laughter what i do know is that talent doesn 't make you gritty <unk> our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments  in fact in our data grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent <unk> so far the best idea i 've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset this is an idea developed at stanford university by carol dweck <unk> and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with your effort dr  dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge  they 're much more likely to persevere when they fail <unk> because they don 't believe that failure is a permanent condition  so growth mindset <unk> is a great idea for building grit <unk> but we need more  and that 's where i 'm going to end my remarks because that 's where we are that 's the work that stands before us we need to take our best ideas our strongest intuitions and we need to test them  we need to measure whether we 've been successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again with lessons <unk> learned in other words <unk> we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier <unk> thank you
