 <unk> grew up singing a song called nothing to envy and i was very proud in school we spent a lot of time <unk> although i often wondered about the outside world <unk>  i thought i would spend my entire life in north korea <unk> until everything suddenly changed <unk>  when i was seven years old <unk> i saw my first public execution <unk> but i thought my life in north korea was normal <unk> family was not poor <unk> and myself i had never experienced hunger <unk> but one day in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five my mom brought home a letter from a coworker 's sister it read  when you read this our five family members will not exist in this world <unk>  because we haven 't eaten for the past three weeks  we are lying on the <unk> floor together <unk> and our bodies are so weak we are waiting to die  i was so shocked <unk> this was the first time i heard that people in my country were suffering  soon after when i was walking past a train station <unk> i saw something terrible that to this day can 't erase from my memory  a lifeless woman was lying on the ground <unk>  while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother 's face <unk>  but nobody helped them <unk> because they were so focused on taking care of themselves <unk> more than a million north koreans died during the famine <unk> and many only survived by eating grass <unk>  bugs and tree bark <unk>  power outages also became more and more frequent so everything around me was completely <unk> for the sea of lights in china just across the river from my home i always wondered why they had lights but we didn 't  this is a satellite picture showing north korea at night <unk> compared to neighbors  this is the amnok river <unk> which serves as a part of the border between north korea <unk> as you can see the river can be very narrow at certain points allowing north koreans to secretly cross <unk>  but many die sometimes <unk> i saw dead bodies floating down the river  i can 't reveal many details about how i left north korea <unk> but i only can <unk> that during the ugly years of the famine i was sent to china to live with distant relatives <unk> but i only thought that i would be separated from my family for a short time  i could have never imagined that it would take fourteen years to live together  in china it was hard living as a young girl without my family <unk> i had no idea what life was going to be like as a north korean but i soon learned it 's not only extremely difficult <unk> it 's also very dangerous <unk>  since north korean refugees are considered in china as illegal migrants  so i was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed <unk> and i would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in north korea <unk> one day my worst nightmare came true <unk> when i was caught by the chinese police <unk> and brought to the police station for interrogation  someone had accused me of being north korean <unk>  so they tested my chinese language abilities <unk> and asked me tons of questions <unk>  i was so scared <unk> if anything seemed unnatural i could be imprisoned and repatriated i thought my life was over <unk>  but i managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions <unk>  after they finished questioning me one official said to another this was a false report <unk>  <unk> me go it was a miracle  some north koreans in china seek asylum in foreign embassies <unk>  but many can be caught by the chinese police and repatriated  these girls were so lucky <unk> even though they were caught they were eventually released after heavy international pressure these north koreans were not so lucky <unk> koreans are caught in china and repatriated to north korea <unk> where they can be tortured <unk> imprisoned or publicly executed  even though i was really fortunate to get out <unk> many other north koreans have not been so lucky <unk>  it 's tragic that north koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive <unk> even after learning a new language and getting a job their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant  that 's why after ten years of hiding my identity i decided to risk going to south korea  and i started a new life yet again <unk> settling down in south korea was a lot more challenging than i had expected <unk>  english was so in south korea so i had to start learning my third language  also i realized there was a wide gap between north and south  we are all korean but inside we have become very different <unk> due to sixty seven years of division  i even went through an identity crisis am i south korean or north korean <unk> where am i from who am i suddenly there was no country i could proudly call my own  even though adjusting to life in south korea was not easy <unk> i made a plan i started studying for the university entrance exam  just as i was starting to get used to my new life <unk> i received a shocking phone call the north korean authorities intercepted some money that i sent to my family and as a punishment my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside  they had to get out quickly so i started planning how to help them escape  north koreans have to travel incredible distances on the it 's almost impossible to cross the border between north korea and south korea <unk>  so ironically <unk> i took a flight back to china and and <unk> north korean border <unk> since my family couldn 't speak chinese i had to guide them somehow through more than two thousand miles in china and then into southeast asia the journey by bus took one week <unk> and we were almost caught several times one time our bus was stopped and boarded by a chinese police officer <unk>  he took everyone 's i d cards <unk> and he started asking them questions <unk> since my family couldn 't as the chinese officer approached my family <unk> i impulsively stood up <unk> and i told him that these are deaf and dumb people that i was chaperoning  he looked at me suspiciously <unk> <unk> but luckily he believed me we made it all the way to the border of laos <unk> my money to bribe the border guards in laos <unk> but even after we got past the border my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing  after i paid the fine and bribe my family was released in one month <unk> but soon after my family was arrested and jailed <unk> in the capital of laos <unk> this was one of the lowest points in my life <unk> i did everything to get my family to freedom <unk> and we came so close <unk> but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the south korean embassy <unk>  i went back and forth between the immigration office and the police <unk> desperately trying to get my family <unk> out  but i didn 't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore <unk>  i lost all hope at that moment i heard one man 's voice ask me what 's wrong i was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask in my broken english <unk> and with a dictionary i explained the situation <unk> and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other north koreans to get out of jail  i thanked him with all my heart <unk> and i asked him why are you helping me  i 'm not helping you he said i 'm helping the north korean people  i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life the kind stranger symbolized new hope <unk> me and the north korean people <unk> when we needed it most <unk> and he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we north korean people need <unk>  eventually after our long journey my family and i were reunited in south <unk> but getting to freedom is only half the battle  many north koreans are separated from their families <unk> and when they arrive in a new country they start with little or no money  so we can benefit from the international community for education <unk> english language training <unk> job training <unk> and more  we can also act as a bridge between the people inside north korea and the outside world <unk> because many <unk> of us stay in contact with family members still inside <unk> and we send information and money that is helping to change north korea from inside <unk>  i 've been so lucky <unk> received so much help and inspiration in my life so i want to help give aspiring north koreans a <unk> i 'm confident that you will see more and more north koreans succeeding all over the world <unk> including the ted stage <unk> thank you
