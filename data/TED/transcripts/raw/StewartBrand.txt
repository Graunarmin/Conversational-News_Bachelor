 <unk> i really should establish my green credentials  when i was a small boy i took my pledge as an american to save and faithfully defend from waste the natural resources of my country its air soil <unk> for a while and then worked for the jerry brown administration <unk>  the brown administration and a bunch of my friends basically leveled the energy efficiency of california so it 's the same now thirty years later even though our economy has gone up eighty percent per capita and we are putting out less greenhouse gasses <unk> than any other state california is basically the equivalent of europe in this this year whole earth catalog has a supplement that i 'll preview today called whole earth discipline  the dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on <unk> be about eighty percent urban and that 's mostly in the developing world where that 's happening  it 's interesting because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities the developing world now has all of the biggest cities <unk> and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries <unk> and nine times bigger it 's qualitatively different they are the drivers of history as we see by looking at history one thousand years ago this is what the world looked like <unk> well we now have a distribution of urban power similar to what we had one thousand years ago in other words the rise of the west dramatic as it was is over  the aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming  one point three million people a week coming to town decade after decade  what 's really going on well what 's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out <unk> subsistence farming is drying up basically people are following opportunity into town <unk> and this is why i used to have a very romantic idea about villages and it 's because i never lived in one  because in town this is the bustling squatter city of kibera <unk> near nairobi they see action they see opportunity they see a cash economy that <unk> were not able to participate in back in the subsistence farm  as you go around these places there 's plenty of aesthetics there is plenty going on they are poor but they are intensely urban  and they are intensely creative <unk> the aggregate numbers now are that basically squatters all one billion of them are building the urban world which means they 're building the world personally one by one family by family clan by clan neighborhood by neighborhood <unk>  they start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by they even build their own infrastructure <unk> well <unk> steal their own infrastructure <unk> at first <unk> cable tv water <unk> the whole gamut all gets stolen <unk> and then gradually gentrifies <unk>  it is not the case that slums undermine prosperity not the working slums <unk> they help create prosperity <unk> so in a town like mumbai which is half slums it 's one 6th of the gdp of india  social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense  these people are valuable as a group and that 's how they work there is a lot of people who think about all these poor people oh there 's terrible things we 've got to fix their housing it used to be oh we 've got to get them phone service <unk> us how they do their phone service <unk> famine mostly is a rural event now there are things they care about  and this is where we can help <unk>  and the nations they 're in can help <unk> and they are helping each other solve these issues and you go to a nice dense place like this slum in mumbai <unk> you look at that lane on the right <unk> and you can ask okay what 's going on there the answer is <unk> is better than a mall <unk> it 's much denser <unk> it 's much more interactive <unk> and the scale is terrific  the main event is these are not people crushed by poverty these are people busy getting out of poverty just as fast as they can they 're helping each other do it  they 're doing it through an outlaw thing the informal <unk> the informal economy it 's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics it 's not supposed to be there but it 's huge we don 't understand how it works yet <unk>  but we have to furthermore people in the informal economy the gray economy as time goes by <unk>  crime is happening around them and they can join the criminal world <unk>  or they can join the legitimate world we should be able to make that choice easier for them to get toward the legitimate world because if we don 't <unk> will go toward the criminal world <unk>  there 's all kinds of activity  in dharavi the slum performs not only a lot of services for itself but it performs services for the city at large and one of the main events are these ad hoc schools parents pool their money to hire some local teachers to a private <unk> tiny <unk> education is more possible in the cities and that changes the world so you see some interesting <unk> typical urban things so one thing slammed up against another <unk> such as in sao paulo here <unk> that 's what cities do that 's how they create value is by slamming things together in this case supply right next to demand so the maids and the gardeners and the guards that live in this lively part of town on the left walk to work in the boring rich neighborhood <unk> is amazing  we are learning about how dense proximity can be  connectivity between the city and the country <unk> this is what makes cities so green in the developing world <unk> because people leave the poverty trap an ecological disaster of subsistence farms and head to town <unk> they 're gone the natural environment starts to come back very rapidly and those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops to send food to the new growing markets in town <unk>  so if you want to save a village you do it with a good road or with a good cell phone connection and ideally some grid electrical power <unk>  so the event is we 're a city <unk> that just happened more than half the numbers are considerable a billion live in the squatter cities now another billion is expected that 's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way <unk> and that will determine a lot of how we function  now for us environmentalists <unk> maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb people get into town <unk> the immediately have <unk> even have to get rich yet just the opportunity of coming up in the world means they will have fewer higher quality kids <unk> and the birthrate goes down radically  very interesting side effect here here 's a slide from phillip longman  shows what is happening as we have more and more old people like me and fewer and fewer babies <unk>  and they are regionally separated what you 're getting is a world which is <unk> old cities  going around doing things the old way in the north and young people in brand new cities they 're inventing doing new things in the south  where do you think the action is going to be <unk>  shift of subject <unk> quickly drop by climate  the climate news i 'm sorry to say is going to keep getting worse than we think <unk> faster than we think climate is a profoundly complex nonlinear runaway positive feedbacks hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points here 's just a few samples  we 're going to keep being surprised <unk> and almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones from your standpoint this means a great increase in climate refugees over the coming decades and what goes along with that which is resource wars and chaos wars as we 're seeing <unk> that 's what drought does it brings carrying capacity down and there 's not enough carrying capacity to support the people and then you 're in trouble <unk> shift to the power situation <unk> baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city or a city planet <unk> so far there is only three sources of baseload electricity coal some gas <unk> nuclear and hydro  of those only nuclear and hydro are green  coal is what is causing the climate problems <unk> and everyone will keep burning it because it 's so cheap until governments make it expensive  wind and solar can 't help because so far we don 't have a way to store that energy  so with hydro maxed out coal and lose the climate or nuclear which is the current operating low carbon source <unk> and maybe save the climate <unk> and if we can eventually get good solar in space that also could help because remember <unk> this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world in the villages and in the cities so between coal and nuclear compare their waste <unk> all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear the amount of waste that would be added up would fit in a coke can  whereas a coal burning plant a normal one gigawatt coal plant burns eighty rail cars of coal a day each car having one hundred tons <unk>  and it puts eighteen thousand tons of carbon dioxide in the air <unk> so and then when you compare the lifetime emissions of these various energy forms nuclear is about even with <unk> solar and wind and ahead of solar oh i 'm sorry with hydro and wind and ahead of solar  and does nuclear really compete with coal just ask the coal miners in australia <unk>  that 's where you see some of the source not from my fellow environmentalists <unk> but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power <unk>  well the good news is that the developing world but frankly the whole world is busy building and starting to build nuclear reactors this is good for the atmosphere it 's good for their prosperity <unk>  i want to point out one interesting thing which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower it 's supposed to be i don 't know local solar and wind and cogeneration and good things like that but frankly <unk> <unk> which are just now coming on might serve even better the russians who started this are building floating <unk> to the standard big iron of an ordinary westinghouse or ariva <unk>  which is one point two one point six billion watts <unk> these things are way smaller <unk> they 're much more adaptable here 's an american design from lawrence livermore lab  here 's another american design that came out of los alamos and is now commercial almost all of these are not only small <unk> typically buried in the ground <unk> and the innovation is moving very rapidly so i think microreactors is going to be important for the future  in terms of proliferation nuclear energy has done more to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other <unk> activity <unk> and that 's why ten percent of the electricity in this room twenty percent of electricity in this room is probably nuclear half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from russia soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads  and so i would like to see the gnep program that was developed in the bush administration go forward aggressively <unk> and i was glad to see that president obama <unk> supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy when he spoke in prague the other week  one more subject <unk> genetically engineered food crops  in my view as a biologist have no reason to be controversial my fellow environmentalists on this subject have been irrational anti scientific and very harmful <unk>  despite their best efforts <unk> genetically engineered crops are the most rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history they 're good for the environment because they enable no till farming which leaves the soil in place getting healthier from year to year slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil into the atmosphere they reduce pesticide use <unk> and they increase yield which allows you to have your agricultural area be smaller <unk> and therefore more wild area is freed <unk> this map from two thousand and six is out of date because it shows africa still under the thumb of greenpeace and friends of the earth from europe <unk> and they 're finally getting out from under that and biotech is moving rapidly in africa at last  this is a moral issue the nuffield council on bioethics met on this issue twice in great detail and said it is a moral imperative to make genetically engineered crops readily available speaking of imperatives geoengineering is taboo now especially in <unk> government circles though i think there was a darpa meeting on it a couple of weeks ago <unk> but it will be on your plate not this year but pretty soon  because some harsh realizations are coming along this is a list of them basically the news is going to keep getting more scary <unk> there will be events  like thirty five thousand people dying of a heat <unk> which happened a while back like cyclones coming up toward bangladesh  like wars over water <unk> such as in the indus <unk>  and as those events keep happening we 're going to say okay what can we do about that really but there 's this little problem with geoengineering  what body is going to decide who gets to engineer how much they do where they do it because everybody is downstream downwind of whatever is done <unk> and if we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization <unk> but if we just say ok china <unk> you 're worried you go ahead you geoengineer your way we 'll geoengineer our way  that would be considered an act of war by both nations  so this is very interesting diplomacy coming along <unk> i <unk> it is more practical than people think here is an example that climatologists like a lot one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas this one came from the sulfur dioxide from mount pinatubo <unk> cooled the earth by half a degree  there was so much ice in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two the following year that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs who were known as the pinatubo cubs to put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year <unk>  that 's nothing compared to all of the other things we may be trying to do about energy just to run by another one this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds by atomizing seawater <unk> that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet a nice one because it can happen lots of little ways in lots of little places is by copying the ancient amazon
