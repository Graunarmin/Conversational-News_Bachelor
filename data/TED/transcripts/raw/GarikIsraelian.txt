 <unk> i have a very difficult task <unk> i 'm a spectroscopist  i have to talk about astronomy without showing you any single image of nebulae or galaxies etc  because my job is spectroscopy <unk> i never deal with images spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world  spectroscopy can probably answer the question is there anybody out there  are we alone seti <unk> it 's not very fun to do spectroscopy one of my colleagues in bulgaria nevena markova spent about twenty <unk> just dedicated to the subject can you imagine day and night <unk> thinking observing the same star for twenty years is incredible but we are crazy we do these things  and i 'm not that far <unk> i spent about eight months working on these profiles <unk>  because i 've noticed a very small symmetry in the profile of one of the planet host stars and i thought maybe there is lithium 6 in this star <unk> which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet <unk>  because apparently you can 't have this fragile isotope of lithium 6 in the atmospheres of sun like stars <unk> but you have it in planets and asteroids so if you isotope in the spectrum of the star <unk> so i invested more than eight months just studying the profile of this star  and actually it 's amazing because i got phone calls from many reporters asking have you actually seen the planet going into a star  because they thought that if you are having a telescope you are an astronomer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope and you might have seen the planet going into a star and i was saying no excuse me what i see is this one  it 's just incredible because nobody understood really  i bet that there were very few people who really understood what i 'm talking about because this is the indication that the planet went into the star <unk> because they actually said that you can get any color you like in a spectrum <unk> and all you need is time and money to make your spectrograph this is the number one high resolution most precise spectrograph on this planet called harps which is actually <unk> used to detect extrasolar planets and sound waves in the atmospheres of stars <unk> how we get spectra <unk> i 'm sure most of you know from school physics that it 's basically splitting a white light into colors <unk> and if you have a liquid hot <unk> it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum a hot gas is producing emission lines only  no continuum <unk> and if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source <unk>  you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines  which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter which is absorbing <unk> exactly at those frequencies now what we can do with the spectra  we can actually study line of sight velocities of cosmic objects <unk>  and we can also study chemical composition and physical parameters of stars galaxies nebulae  a star is the most simple object in the core <unk> we have thermonuclear reactions going on  creating chemical elements <unk> and we have a cool atmosphere <unk> it 's cool for me cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees my colleagues in infra red astronomy call minus two hundred kelvin is cool for them but you know everything is relative so for me five thousand degrees is pretty cool  this is the spectrum of the sun twenty four thousand spectral lines <unk> and about fifteen percent of these lines is not yet <unk> identified it is amazing so we are in the 21st century <unk> and we still cannot properly understand the spectrum of the sun <unk> sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere <unk> for instance you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the sun <unk> and we use this weak <unk> feature to measure the composition of gold in the atmosphere of the sun <unk> and now this is a work in progress we have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature which belongs to osmium it 's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae it 's the only place where you can produce actually osmium just comparing composition of osmium in one of the planet host stars <unk>  we want to understand why there is so much of this element perhaps we even think that maybe supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars it can be an indication  the other day my colleague from berkeley <unk> gibor basri emailed me a very interesting spectrum asking <unk> this and i couldn 't sleep <unk> next two weeks  when i saw the huge amount of oxygen and other elements in the spectrum of the stars i knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy  it was incredible the only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system <unk> which polluted the atmosphere of this star <unk> and later a black hole was formed in a binary system <unk> which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses this was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from supernovae explosions my colleagues comparing composition of chemical elements in different galactic stars <unk> actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy it 's amazing that you can go so far simply studying the chemical composition of stars <unk> they actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien it comes from a different galaxy  there is interaction of galaxies we know this and sometimes they just capture stars  you 've heard about solar flares <unk> we were very surprised to <unk> discover a super flare  a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the sun  in one of the binary stars in our galaxy called fh leo <unk>  we discovered the super flare <unk> and later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything <unk> and we found that everything is normal  these stars are normal like the sun <unk> age everything was normal <unk> so this is a mystery it 's one of the mysteries we still have super flares <unk>  and there are six or seven similar cases reported in the literature <unk>  now to go ahead with this <unk> we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe it 's very complicated i don 't really want you to try to understand what is here it 's to show you how complicated is the whole story of the production of chemical elements you have two channels the massive stars and low mass stars producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe <unk>  and doing this for fourteen billion years <unk> we end up with this picture which is a very important graph <unk> showing relative abundances of chemical elements in <unk> interstellar medium <unk>  so which means that it 's really impossible to find an object where you find about ten times more sulfur than silicon  five times more calcium than oxygen it 's just impossible <unk> and if you find one i will say that this is something related to seti <unk> because naturally you can 't do <unk> doppler effect is something very important from fundamental physics and this is related to the change of the frequency of a moving source  the doppler effect is used to discover extrasolar planets  the precision which we need to discover a jupiter like planet around a sun like star is something like twenty eight point four meters per second <unk> and we need nine centimeters per second to detect <unk> this can be done with the future spectrographs i myself <unk>  i 'm actually involved in the team which is developing a codex high resolution future generation spectrograph for the forty two meter <unk> e elt telescope and this is going to be an instrument to detect earth like planets <unk> is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of stars <unk> this is the sound of an alpha cen  we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of sun like stars <unk> those waves have frequencies in infrasound domain the sound actually nobody knows domain coming back to the most <unk> is there anybody out there this is closely related to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets <unk>  connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward no life without tectonic activity without volcanic activity <unk>  and we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of <unk> and potassium  how to measure if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small <unk>  so those planets are tectonically dead there cannot be life  if there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium  probably <unk> again there would be no life because can you imagine everything boiling it 's too much energy on a planet <unk>  now we have been measuring abundance of thorium in one of the stars with <unk> extrasolar planets <unk> it 's exactly the same game a very tiny feature  we are actually trying to measure this profile and to detect thorium <unk> it 's very tough <unk> it 's very tough <unk> and you have to first you have to convince yourself  then you have to convince your colleagues and then you have to convince the whole world that you have actually detected something like this in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in one hundred <unk> parsec away from here it 's really difficult but if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets you have to do this job because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have in those systems  the one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals if you receive something interesting <unk> well that 's what seti does actually what seti has been doing for many years <unk> i think the most promising way is to go for biomarkers  you can see the spectrum of the earth this earthshine spectrum <unk>  and that is a very clear signal the slope which is coming which we call a red edge is a <unk> we can detect vegetation from a spectrum <unk> now imagine doing this test for other planets <unk>  now very recently very recently i 'm talking about last six seven eight months  water <unk> methane  carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system <unk> it 's amazing <unk> so this is the power of spectroscopy you can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets far far far from solar system <unk> we have to detect oxygen or ozone to make sure that we have all necessary conditions to have life <unk> cosmic miracles are something which can be related to seti <unk>  now imagine an object amazing object or something which we cannot explain when we just stand up and say look we give up physics doesn 't work  so it 's something which you can always refer to seti and say well somebody must be doing this <unk> somehow  and with the known physics etc <unk> it 's something actually which has been pointed out by frank drake many years ago and shklovsky if you see in the spectrum of a planet host star <unk> if you see strange chemical elements <unk> it can be a signal from a civilization which is there and they want to signal about it they want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines in the spectrum of a star <unk> can be different ways doing this one is for instance technetium is a radioactive element with a decay time of four point two million years  if you suddenly observe technetium in a sun like star <unk> you can be sure that somebody has put this element in the atmosphere because in a natural way it is impossible to do this now we are reviewing the spectra of about three hundred stars with extrasolar planets and we are doing this job since two thousand and it 's a very heavy project <unk> we have been working very hard <unk> and we have some interesting cases  candidates so on things which we can 't really explain and i hope in the near <unk> is the spectrum of
