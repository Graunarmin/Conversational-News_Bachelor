 <unk> people back home call me a heckler a troublemaker an irritant a rebel an activist the voice of the people <unk>  but that wasn <unk> meaning the soft harmless boy <unk> like every other human being i avoided trouble in my childhood they taught me silence don 't argue do as you 're told  in sunday school they taught me don 't confront <unk> don 't argue even if you 're right <unk> turn the other cheek  this was reinforced by the political climate <unk> kenya is a country where you are guilty until proven rich  kenya 's poor are five times more likely to be shot dead by the police who are meant to protect them than by criminals  this was reinforced by the political climate of the day we had a president moi who was a <unk> he ruled the country with an iron fist and anyone who dared question his authority was arrested <unk> tortured <unk> jailed or even killed <unk>  that meant that people were taught to be smart cowards stay out of trouble being a coward was not an insult being a coward was a compliment <unk> we used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother what that meant that if you stayed out of trouble you 're going to stay alive i used to question this advice and eight years ago we had an election in kenya <unk> results were violently disputed what followed that election was terrible violence rape <unk> and the killing of over one thousand people my work was to document the violence as a photographer i took thousands of images  and after two months the two politicians came together had a cup of tea <unk>  signed a peace <unk> and the country moved on i was a very disturbed man because i saw the violence firsthand  i saw the killings <unk> i saw the displacement <unk> i met women who had been raped <unk> and it disturbed me  but the country never spoke about it <unk> we pretended <unk> we all became smart cowards <unk> we decided to stay out of trouble and not talk about <unk> my job i said i could not stand it anymore after quitting my job i decided to organize my friends to speak about the violence in the country to speak about the state of the nation  and june one two thousand and nine was the day that we were meant to go to the stadium and try and get the president 's attention it 's a national holiday it 's broadcast across the country and i showed up at the stadium my friends did not show <unk> i was scared <unk> but i knew very well that that particular day i had to make a decision was i able to live as a coward like everyone else or was i going to make a stand <unk>  and when the president stood up to speak <unk> i found myself on my feet shouting at the president <unk> telling him to remember the post election violence victims to stop the corruption <unk> and suddenly out of nowhere the police pounced on me like hungry lions they held my mouth and dragged me out of the stadium <unk> where they thoroughly beat me up and locked me up in jail <unk> i spent that night in a cold cement floor in the jail <unk> and that got me <unk> what was making me feel this way my friends and family thought i was crazy because of what i did <unk> and the images that i took were disturbing my life the images that i took were just a number to many kenyans most kenyans did not see the violence it was a story to them  and so i decided to actually start a street exhibition to show the images of the violence across the country and get people talking about <unk> we traveled the country and showed the images and this was a journey that has started me to the activist path where i decided to become silent no more to talk about those things <unk> we traveled <unk> and our general site from our street exhibit became for political graffiti about the situation in the country talking about corruption <unk> bad leadership <unk> we have even done <unk> we have delivered live pigs to kenya 's parliament as a symbol of our politicians ' greed it has been done in uganda and other countries and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country <unk> across the continent where i used to stand up alone seven years ago now i belong to a community of many people who stand up with me  i am no longer alone when i stand up to speak about these things <unk>  i belong to a group of young people who are <unk> passionate about the country who want to bring about change <unk> and they 're no longer afraid and they 're no longer smart cowards <unk>  so that was my story  that day in the stadium <unk>  i stood up as a smart coward by that one action <unk> i said goodbye to the twenty four years living as a coward <unk> days in your life the day you 're born <unk> and the day you discover why that day standing up in that stadium shouting at the president <unk> i discovered why i was truly born that i would no longer be silent in the face of injustice  do you know why you were <unk> you 've created a studio a place where young people can go and harness the power of digital media to <unk> do some of this action  what 's happening now with pawa boniface mwangi so we have this community of filmmakers graffiti artists <unk> musicians and when there 's an issue in the country <unk> we come together <unk> we brainstorm and take up on that issue <unk> so <unk> our most powerful tool is art <unk> because we live in a very busy world where people are <unk> spite of being arrested beaten up  threatened the moment i discovered my voice that i could actually stand up for what i really believed in i 'm no longer afraid <unk> i used to be called softy <unk> but i 'm no longer softy <unk> because i discovered who i really am as in that 's what i want to do and there 's such beauty in doing that there 's nothing as powerful as that <unk> knowing that i 'm meant to do this because you don 't get scared you just continue living your life
