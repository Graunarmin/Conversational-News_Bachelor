 <unk> every summer my family and i travel across the world <unk> three thousand miles away to the culturally diverse country of india <unk>  now india is a country infamous for its scorching heat and humidity for me the only relief from this heat is to drink plenty of water <unk>  now <unk> while in india <unk> my parents always remind me to only drink boiled or bottled water <unk>  because unlike here in america <unk> where i can just turn on a tap and easily get clean potable water <unk>  in india the water is often contaminated <unk> so my parents have to make sure that the water we drink is safe <unk> i soon realized that not everyone is fortunate enough to enjoy the clean water we did <unk>  outside my grandparents ' house in the busy streets of india <unk> i saw people standing in long lines under the hot sun filling buckets with water from a tap i even saw children who looked the same age as me <unk> filling up these clear plastic bottles with dirty water from streams on the roadside watching these kids forced to drink water that i felt was too dirty to touch changed my perspective on the world  this unacceptable social injustice compelled me to want to find a solution to our world 's clean water <unk> problem <unk>  i wanted to know why these kids lacked water <unk>  a substance that is essential for life and i learned that we are facing a global water crisis <unk>  now <unk> this may seem surprising as seventy five percent of our planet is covered in water <unk>  but only two point five percent of that is freshwater  and less than one <unk> percent of earth 's freshwater supply is available for human consumption  with rising populations industrial development and economic growth our demand for clean water is increasing <unk>  yet our freshwater resources are rapidly depleting <unk>  according to the world health organization <unk> six hundred and sixty million people in our world lack access to a clean water source <unk>  lack of access to clean water is a leading cause of death in children under the age of five in developing countries and unicef estimates that three thousand children die every day from a water related disease <unk>  so after returning home one summer in eighth <unk> i decided that i wanted to combine my passion for solving the global water crisis with my interest in science  so i decided that the best thing to do would be to convert my garage into a laboratory  actually at first i converted my kitchen into a laboratory but my parents didn 't really approve and kicked me out <unk> i also read a lot of journal papers on <unk> research and i learned that currently in developing countries <unk> something called solar disinfection or sodis is used to purify water in sodis clear plastic bottles are filled with contaminated water and then exposed to sunlight for six to eight hours  the uv radiation from the <unk> really easy to use and energy efficient as it only uses solar energy it 's really slow as it can take up to two days when it 's cloudy <unk>  so in order to make the sodis process faster this new method called has recently been used so what exactly is this <unk> down photo means from the sun and a catalyst is something that speeds up a reaction <unk>  so what photocatalysis is doing is it 's just speeding up this solar disinfection process  when sunlight comes in and strikes a <unk> <unk> or titanium dioxide it creates <unk> hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals  these reactive oxygen species are able to remove bacteria and organics and a whole lot of contaminants from drinking water <unk>  but unfortunately there are several disadvantages to the way photocatalytic sodis is currently deployed <unk> see <unk> what they do is they take the clear plastic bottles and they coat the inside with this <unk> photocatalytic coating <unk> but like titanium dioxide are actually commonly used in sunscreens to block uv radiation  so when they 're coated on the inside of these bottles they 're actually blocking some of the uv radiation and diminishing the efficiency of the process  <unk> these photocatalytic coatings are not tightly bound to the plastic bottle <unk> which means they wash off and people end up drinking the catalyst  while tio2 is safe and inert it 's really inefficient if you keep drinking the catalyst because then you have to continue to replenish it even after a few uses  so my goal was to overcome the disadvantages of these current treatment methods and create a safe <unk> purifying water <unk>  what started off as an eighth grade science fair project is now my photocatalytic composite for water purification  the composite combines titanium dioxide with cement  the cement like composite can be formed into several different shapes <unk> which results in an extremely versatile range of deployment methods  for example you could create a rod <unk> rod that can easily be placed inside water bottles for individual use or you could create a porous filter that can filter water for families  you can even coat the inside of an existing water tank to purify larger amounts of water for communities over a longer period of time  now <unk> over the course of this my journey hasn 't really been easy you know i didn 't have access to a sophisticated laboratory <unk> i was fourteen years old when i started but i didn 't let my age deter me in my interest <unk> <unk> in pursuing scientific research and wanting to solve the global water crisis <unk>  <unk> and for that reason i 'm continuing to work on this science fair project from two thousand and twelve to bring it from the laboratory into the real world and this summer <unk> i founded <unk> catalyst for world water <unk> a social enterprise aimed at catalyzing solutions to the global water crisis  <unk> a single drop of water can 't do much <unk> but when many drops come together they can sustain life on our planet  just as water drops come together to form oceans <unk> i believe that we all must come together when tackling this global problem <unk> thank you
