 <unk> can we dare to be optimistic <unk> well the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for forty years <unk> and hence diverging from the rest of mankind and so the real question to pose is not can we be optimistic it 's how can we give credible hope to that billion people  that to my mind is the fundamental challenge now of development <unk>  what i 'm going to offer you is a recipe a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good <unk> which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened <unk> compassion because a billion people are living in societies that have not offered credible hope that is a human tragedy <unk> enlightened <unk> because if that economic divergence continues for another forty <unk> years <unk>  combined with social integration globally <unk> it will build a nightmare for our children  we need compassion to get ourselves started and enlightened <unk> to get ourselves serious <unk> that 's the alliance that changes the world <unk> mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion <unk> what can we actually do <unk>  well a good guide is to think what did we do last time the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world that gives us it turns out quite a good clue except you have to go back quite a long time the last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late <unk> the rich world was you america <unk> and the region that needed to be developed was my <unk> why did america get serious <unk> it wasn 't just compassion for europe <unk> though there was that it was that you knew you had to because in the late <unk> country after country in central europe was falling into the soviet bloc <unk>  and so you knew you 'd no choice europe had to be dragged into economic development <unk> so what did you do last time you got serious <unk>  well <unk> yes <unk> you had a big aid program <unk> thank you very much <unk> that was marshall aid we need to do it again  aid is part of the solution <unk> but what else did you do  well <unk> you tore up your trade policy <unk> and totally reversed <unk> before the war <unk> america had been highly protectionist <unk> after the war <unk>  you opened your markets to europe you dragged europe into the then global economy which was your economy <unk> and you institutionalized that trade liberalization through founding the general agreement on tariffs and trade  so total reversal of trade policy  did you do anything else <unk> yes <unk> you totally reversed your security policy <unk> before the war your security policy had <unk> been isolationist <unk> after the war <unk> you tear that up you put one hundred thousand troops in europe for over forty years <unk>  so <unk> total reversal of security policy <unk> anything else <unk> yes <unk> you tear up the eleventh commandment national sovereignty <unk>  before the war <unk> you treated national sovereignty as so <unk> sacrosanct that you weren 't even willing to join the league of nations <unk>  after the war <unk> you found the united nations <unk> you found the organization for economic cooperation and development <unk> you found the imf you encouraged europe to create the european community all systems for mutual government support  that is still the waterfront of effective <unk> policies  aid trade security governments  of course the details of policy are going to be different <unk> because the challenge is different <unk> it 's not rebuilding europe <unk>  it 's reversing the divergence for the bottom billion <unk> so that they actually catch up is that easier or harder  we need to be at least as <unk> serious as we were then <unk> now today i 'm going to take just one of those four i 'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest the one that 's just motherhood and apple pie governments mutual systems of support for governments and i 'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance and i 'm going to show you that that is enormously important now <unk>  the opportunity we 're going to look to is is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion <unk> and that is the commodity booms the commodity booms <unk> are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many <unk> though not all of the countries of the bottom billion <unk>  partly they 're pumping money in because commodity prices are high <unk> but it 's not just that there 's also a range of new discoveries <unk> uganda has just discovered oil in about the most disastrous location on earth ghana has discovered oil <unk>  guinea has got a huge new exploitation exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground so a mass of new discoveries <unk>  between them  these new revenue flows dwarf aid  just to give you one example angola alone is getting fifty billion dollars a year in oil revenue aid flows to the sixty countries of the bottom billion last year were thirty four billion  so the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion are without precedent <unk> so there 's the optimism the question is how is it going to help their development it 's a huge opportunity for transformational development <unk> will it be taken so <unk> here comes a bit of science and this is a bit of science i 've done since the bottom billion so it 's new  i 've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports <unk> and the growth of commodity exporting countries  and i 've looked globally <unk> i 've taken all the countries in the world for the last forty years <unk> and looked to see what the relationship <unk> is <unk> and the the short run <unk> say the first five to seven years is just great in fact it 's hunky dory <unk> everything goes up you get more money because your terms of trade have improved but also that drives up output across the board so gdp goes up a lot fantastic <unk> that 's the short run and how about the long run <unk> come back fifteen years later <unk>  well <unk> the short run <unk> it 's hunky dory <unk> but the long run <unk> it 's humpty dumpty you go up in the short run <unk> but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they 'd had no booms at all  that is not a forecast about how commodity <unk> prices go <unk> it 's a forecast of the consequences the long term consequences for growth of an increase in prices  so what goes wrong why is there this resource curse as it 's called  and again i 've looked at that and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of governance <unk> the initial level of economic governance <unk> resource booms accrue  in fact if you 've got good enough governance there is no resource boom <unk> you go up in the short term <unk>  and then you go up even more in the long term <unk> that 's norway the richest country in europe <unk> it 's australia it 's canada  the resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a <unk> threshold of governance they still go up in the short run <unk> that 's what we 're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment <unk> the best growth rates they 've had ever and the question is whether the short run will persist and with bad governance historically over the last forty years it hasn 't it 's countries like nigeria which are worse off than if they 'd never had oil <unk> <unk> there 's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term and below which you go down  just to benchmark that threshold it 's about the governance level of portugal in the mid 1980s  so the question is are the bottom billion above or below that threshold now there 's one big change since the commodity booms of <unk> is the spread of democracy <unk>  so i thought well maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy  so i looked  democracy does have significant effects and unfortunately they 're adverse <unk> democracies make even more <unk> two distinct aspects of democracy  there 's electoral competition which determines how you acquire power <unk> and there are checks and balances which determine how you use power <unk> <unk> it turns out that electoral competition is the thing that 's doing the damage with democracy <unk> whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good <unk> and so <unk> what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances <unk>  they haven 't got them <unk> they got instant democracy in the <unk> elections without checks and balances how can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances in all the societies of the bottom billion <unk> there are intense struggles to do just that  the simple proposal is that we should have some international standards <unk> which will be voluntary <unk> but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order to harness these resource revenues we know these international standards <unk> work because we 've already got one it 's called the extractive industries transparency initiative  that is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have  no sooner was it proposed than reformers in nigeria adopted it  pushed it and published the revenues in the paper <unk> nigerian newspapers circulations spiked people wanted <unk> to know what their government was getting in terms of revenue <unk> so we know it works what would the content be of these international standards i can 't go through all of them <unk> but i 'll give you an example <unk> the first is how to take the resources out of the ground the economic processes taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top <unk> of the ground  and the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction  you know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment how they 've been sold over the last forty years  a company flies in does a deal with a minister <unk> and that 's great for the company <unk> and it 's quite often great for the minister <unk> technology which can transform that and it 's called verified auctions <unk>  the public agency with the greatest expertise on earth is of course the treasury that is the british treasury <unk>  and the british treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth <unk> they worked out they were worth two billion pounds just in time a set of economists got there and said why not try an auction <unk> it 'll reveal the value  it went for twenty billion pounds through auction <unk> if the british treasury can be out by a factor of ten  think what the ministry of finance in sierra leone is going to be like  <unk> when i put that to the president of sierra leone the next day he asked the world bank to send him a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions <unk>  there are five such decision points each one needs an international standard <unk> if we could do it  we would change the world we would be helping the reformers in these societies who are <unk> for change  that 's our modest role  we cannot change these societies <unk> but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing <unk>  because the odds are so stacked against them <unk>  and yet we 've not got these rules if you think about it <unk> the cost of promulgating international rules <unk> why on earth are they not there  i realized that the reason they 're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies politicians will get away with gestures that unless we have an informed society <unk> what politicians do especially in relation to africa is gestures <unk> things that look good <unk> but don 't work  and so i realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry
