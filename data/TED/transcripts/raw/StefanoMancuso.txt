 <unk> a very old magazine i found this observation test about the story of the ark  and the artist that drew this observation test did some errors had some mistakes there are more or less twelve mistakes some of them are very easy there is a funnel  an aerial part a lamp and clockwork key on the ark <unk> some of them are about the animals the number <unk> but there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that 's not reported here <unk>  and this problem is  <unk> now we have god that is going to submerge earth permanently or at least for a very long period <unk> and no one is taking care of plants noah needed to take two of every kind of bird of every kind of animal of every kind of creature that moves <unk> but no mention about plants <unk> why  in another part of the same story all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out <unk> from the ark <unk> so birds livestock and wild animals  plants are not living creatures this is the point that is a point that is not coming out from the bible but it 's something that really accompanied humanity <unk> let 's have a look at this nice code that is coming from a renaissance book here we have the description <unk> of the order of nature <unk> it 's a nice description because it 's starting from left you have the stones immediately after the stones the plants that are just able to live we have the animals that are able to live and to sense <unk>  and on the top of the pyramid <unk> there is the man this is not the common man <unk> is quite comforting for people like me i 'm a professor this to be over there on the top of creation but it 's something completely wrong <unk>  you know very well about professors but it 's also wrong about plants <unk>  because plants are not just able to live they are able to <unk> they are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals just to give you an example every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least fifteen different chemical and physical parameters  and they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence well <unk> this is something this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us  let 's have a look at this short movie now we have david attenborough <unk> now david attenborough is really a plant lover  he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior now <unk> when he speaks about plants <unk> to remove the fact that plants exist <unk>  the blue whale <unk> the biggest creature that exists on the planet that is wrong <unk> completely wrong <unk> the blue whale <unk> it 's a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet that is this wonderful <unk> this is a living organism that has a mass of at least two thousand tons <unk> now <unk> the story that plants are some <unk> low level organisms has been formalized many times ago by aristotle that in de anima that is a very influential book for the western civilization wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living <unk> they have just a kind of very low level soul <unk> it 's called the vegetative soul because they lack movement <unk> and so they don 't need to sense <unk>  let 's see okay some of the movements of the plants are very well known this is <unk> very fast movement this is a dionaea a venus fly trap hunting snails sorry for the snail  this has been something that has been refused for centuries despite the evidence  no one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal <unk> because it was against the order of nature <unk>  but plants are also able to to show a lot of movement some of them are very well known like the flowering it 's just a question to <unk> to use some techniques like the time lapse some of them are much more sophisticated look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time and it 's really so graceful it 's like a dancing angel <unk>  they are also able to play they are really <unk> and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing <unk> they are training themselves  as many young animals do to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day <unk>  they are able to respond to gravity of course so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the <unk> vector of gravity <unk> but they are also able to sleep <unk> this is one mimosa pudica <unk> so during the night they curl the leaves and reduce the movement and during the day you have the opening of the leaves there is much more movement <unk> this is interesting because this sleeping machinery <unk> it 's perfectly conserved it 's the same in plants in insects and in animals  and so if you need to study this sleeping problem it 's easy to study on plants for example <unk> than in animals <unk> and it 's much more easy even ethically it 's a kind of vegetarian experimentation plants are even able to communicate they are extraordinary communicators they communicate with other plants <unk> they are able to <unk> distinguish kin and non kin they communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles  for example during the pollination now with the pollination it 's a very serious issue for plants because they move the pollen from one flower to the other yet they cannot move from one flower to the other so they need a vector and this vector <unk> normally an animal many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination but not just insects even birds reptiles <unk> and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen <unk> this is a serious business we have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance very energizing having in change this transportation of the pollen but some plants are manipulating animals like in the case of orchids <unk> <unk> that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen to do this without a brain we need to wait until one thousand eight hundred and eighty when this big man charles darwin <unk> publishes a wonderful astonishing book that starts a revolution <unk> the title is the power of movement in plants no one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before charles darwin  in his book <unk>  assisted by his son <unk> francis who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world in cambridge they took into consideration every single movement for five hundred pages and in the last paragraph of the book it 's a kind of stylistic mark because normally charles darwin stored in the last paragraph of of a book <unk> the most important <unk> it 's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals this is not a metaphor  he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was j d hooker or at that time president of the royal society so the maximum scientific authority in britain speaking <unk> about the brain in the plants now <unk> this is a root apex growing against a slope <unk>  so you can recognize this kind of movement the same movement that worms snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display  and it 's not an easy movement because to have this kind of movement you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having <unk> a brain <unk> so we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here <unk> depicted in blue that is called the transition zone and this region it 's a very small region it 's less than one millimeter <unk>  and in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important you have kinds of signals here <unk>  the signals that you are seeing here are action potential are the same signals that the neurons of my brain of our brain use to to exchange information  now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of <unk> but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant like a plant of rye <unk> we have almost fourteen million roots  we have eleven and a half million root apex and a total length of six hundred or more kilometers and a very high surface area now let 's imagine that each single root apex is working in network with <unk> have on the left the internet and on the right the root apparatus they work in the same way they are a network of small computing machines working in networks and why are they so similar  because they evolved for the same reason  to survive predation  <unk> they work in the same way <unk> so you can remove ninety percent of the root apparatus and the plants [ continue ] to work you can remove ninety percent of the internet and <unk> to work so a suggestion for the people working with networks plants <unk> possibility let 's imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants <unk> until now  the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing <unk> we have the animaloid <unk> but why have we not any plantoid well if you want to fly <unk> it 's good that you look at birds to be inspired by birds but if you want to explore soils or if you want to colonize <unk> best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this  we have another possibility we are working [ on ] in our lab [ which ] is to build hybrids <unk> it 's much more easy to build hybrids hybrid means it 's something that 's half living and half machine it 's much more easy to work with plants than with animals <unk>  <unk> they have electrical signals the connection with the machine is much more easy much more even ethically possible and these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids <unk> driven by algae or by the leaves at the end by the most most powerful parts of the plants by the roots <unk> well <unk> thank you for your attention <unk> attention and before i finish i would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making this presentation <unk> thank you
