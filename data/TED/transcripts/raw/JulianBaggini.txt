 <unk> a real you this might seem to you like a very odd question <unk>  because you might ask how do we find the real you how do you know what the real you is and so forth <unk> but the idea <unk> there must be a real you <unk> surely that 's obvious if there 's anything real in the world it 's you <unk>  well <unk> i 'm not quite sure at least we have to understand a bit better what that means now certainly i think there are lots of things in our culture around us which sort of reinforce the idea that for each one of us we have a kind of a core an essence there is something about what it means to be you which defines you and it 's kind of <unk> the most kind of crude way in which we have it are things like horoscopes you know people are very wedded to these actually <unk> people put them on their facebook profile as though they are meaningul you even know your chinese horoscope as well <unk>  there are also more scientific versions of this  all sorts of ways of profiling personality type <unk> such as the <unk> myers briggs tests for example i don 't know if you 've done those a lot of companies use these for <unk> you answer a lot of questions <unk> and this is supposed to reveal something about your your core personality and of course the popular fascination with this is enormous in magazines like this <unk> you 'll see in the bottom left corner they 'll advertise in virtually every issue some kind of personality thing and if you pick up one of those magazines it 's hard to resist isn 't it doing the test to find what is your learning style what is your <unk> is your working style <unk> are you this kind of person or that so i think that we have a <unk> <unk> idea that there is a kind of core or essence of ourselves to be discovered <unk> and that this is kind of a permanent truth about ourselves something that 's the same throughout life well that 's the idea i want to challenge <unk> and i have to say now i 'll say it a bit later but i 'm not challenging this just because i 'm weird <unk> the challenge actually has a very very long and distinguished <unk> history here 's the common sense idea  there is you you are the individuals you are and you have this kind of core <unk> now in your life what happens is that you of course accumulate different <unk> experiences and so forth <unk> so you have memories <unk> and these memories help to create what you are you have desires maybe for a cookie <unk> maybe for something that we don 't want to talk about at eleven o 'clock <unk> in the morning in a school <unk> you will have beliefs this is a number plate from someone in america <unk> i don 't know whether this number plate which says messiah one indicates that the driver believes in the messiah or that they are the messiah <unk>  either way they have beliefs about messiahs we have knowledge we have sensations and experiences as well it 's not just intellectual things  so this is kind of the common sense model <unk> i think of what a person <unk> is there is a a person who has all the things that make up our life experiences <unk> but the suggestion i want to put to you today is that there 's something fundamentally wrong with this model <unk> and i can show you what 's wrong with one click which is there isn 't actually a <unk> there are memories desires intentions sensations and so forth <unk> but what happens is these things exist <unk> and they 're kind of all integrated they 're overlapped they 're connected in various different ways  they 're connecting partly and perhaps even mainly because they all belong to one body and one brain but there 's also a narrative a story we tell about ourselves the experiences we have when we remember past <unk> things we do things because of other things so what we desire is partly a result of what we believe and what we remember is also informing us what we know  and so really there are all these things like beliefs desires sensations experiences  they 're all related to each other <unk> and that just is you common sense understanding <unk> in some ways it 's a massive one it 's the shift between thinking of yourself as a thing which has all the experiences of life <unk> and thinking of yourself as simply that collection of all experiences in life you are the sum of your parts <unk>  now those parts are also physical parts of course brains bodies and <unk> if you have a heart transplant you 're still the same person if you have a memory transplant <unk> are you the same person if you have a belief transplant would you be the same person <unk>  now this idea  that what we are the way to understand ourselves is as not of some permanent being which has experiences <unk> but is kind of a collection of experiences  might strike you as kind of weird <unk> but actually i don 't think it should be weird <unk> in a way it 's common sense because i just invite you to think about by comparison <unk> <unk> think about pretty much anything else in the universe maybe apart from the very most fundamental forces or powers <unk> let 's take something like water <unk> <unk>  now my science isn 't very good <unk> we might say something like water has two parts hydrogen and one parts oxygen right  <unk> i hope no one in this room thinks that what that means is there is a thing called water  and attached to it are hydrogen and oxygen atoms and that 's what water is of course we don 't we understand very easily very straightforwardly that water <unk> <unk> is nothing more than the hydrogen and oxygen molecules suitably arranged  <unk> we say the watch has a face <unk> and hands <unk> and a mechanism and a battery <unk>  but what we really mean is we don 't think there is a thing called the watch to which we then attach all these bits <unk>  we understand very clearly that you get the parts of the watch you put them together <unk> and you create a watch <unk> now if everything else in the universe is like this <unk> why <unk> think of ourselves as somehow not just being a collection of all our parts <unk> but somehow being a separate permanent entity which has those parts <unk>  now this view is not particularly new actually it has quite a long lineage you find it in buddhism <unk>  you find it in 17th 18th century philosophy going through to the current day <unk> people like locke and hume <unk>  but interestingly it 's also a view increasingly being heard reinforced by neuroscience paul broks he 's a clinical neuropsychologist  and he says this we have a deep intuition that there is a core an essence there and it 's hard to shake off probably impossible to shake off <unk> i suspect <unk> but it 's true <unk> <unk> that neuroscience shows that there is no centre in the brain where things do all come together  <unk> and you look at how the brain makes possible a sense of self <unk>  you find that there isn 't a central control spot in the brain there is no kind of center where everything happens there are lots of different processes in the brain all of which operate in a way quite independently <unk>  but it 's because of the way that they relate that we get this sense of self <unk> we don 't exist it 's just that the trick is to make us feel that inside of us is something more unified than is really there <unk>  now you might think this is a worrying idea <unk>  you might think that if it 's true that for each one of us there is no abiding core of self no permanent essence <unk>  does that mean that really the <unk> self is an illusion <unk> does it mean that we really don 't exist <unk>  there is no real you well a lot of people actually do use this talk of illusion and so forth these are three psychologists thomas metzinger bruce hood susan blackmore  a lot of these people do talk the language of illusion the self is an illusion it 's a fiction i don 't think this is a very helpful way of looking at it go back to the watch the watch isn 't an illusion <unk> because there is nothing to the watch other than a collection of its parts  <unk> in the same way we 're not illusions either the fact that we are <unk> in some ways just this very very complex <unk> now if you take something like this you can appreciate the fact that in lots of ways <unk> there 's nothing permanent about this for one thing it 's always changing the waters are always carving <unk> <unk> new <unk> channels with changes and tides and the weather some things dry up <unk> new things are created of course the water that flows through the waterfall is different every single instance but it doesn 't mean that the iguazu falls are an illusion it doesn 't mean it 's not real  what it means is we have to understand what it is as something which has a history has certain things that keep it together <unk>  but it 's a process it 's fluid it 's forever changing <unk>  now that i think is a model for understanding ourselves and i think it 's a <unk> if you think that you have this fixed permanent essence which is always the same throughout your life no matter what <unk> in a sense you 're kind of trapped <unk> you 're born with an essence that 's what you are until you die <unk> if you believe in an afterlife maybe you continue <unk> but if you think of yourself as being in a way not a thing as such but a kind of a process something <unk> i think that 's quite liberating because unlike the the waterfalls we actually have the capacity to channel the direction of our development for ourselves to a certain degree  now we 've got to be careful here right <unk> if you watch the x factor too much <unk> you might buy into this idea that we can all be whatever we want to be that 's not true i 've heard some fantastic <unk> <unk> musicians this morning <unk> and i am very confident that i could in no way be as good as them i could practice hard and maybe be good <unk> but i don 't <unk> have that really natural ability there are limits to what we can achieve <unk> there are limits to what we can make of ourselves <unk>  but nevertheless we do have this capacity to in a sense shape ourselves <unk>  the true self as it were then is not something that is just there for you to discover <unk> you don 't sort of look into your soul and find your true self what you are partly doing at least is actually creating your true self <unk>  and this i think is very very significant <unk> particularly at this stage of life you 're at you 'll be aware of the fact how much of you changed over recent years if you have any videos of yourself three or four years ago <unk> you probably feel embarrassed because you don 't recognize yourself <unk> your true self
