 <unk> i guess the story actually has to start maybe back in the the 1960s when i was seven or eight years old <unk> watching jacques cousteau documentaries on the living room floor with my mask and flippers on <unk>  then after every episode i had to go up to the bathtub and swim around <unk> bathtub and look at the drain because that 's all there was to look at and by the time i turned sixteen i pursued a career in marine science in exploration and diving and lived in underwater habitats like this one off the florida keys for thirty days total <unk> brian skerry took this shot thanks brian  and i 've dived <unk> around the world and this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world <unk> operated by the japanese government  and sylvia earle and i were on an expedition in this submarine twenty years ago in japan and on my dive i went down eighteen thousand feet  to an area that i thought would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor <unk> but when i got there i found lots of plastic garbage and <unk> and it was really a turning point in my life where i started to realize that i couldn 't just go have fun doing science and exploration <unk> i needed to put it into a context i needed to head towards conservation goals <unk>  so i began to work with national geographic society and others and led expeditions to antarctica i led three diving expeditions to antarctica <unk> ten years ago was a seminal trip <unk> where we explored that big iceberg b 15 the largest iceberg in history that broke off <unk> the ross ice shelf <unk>  and we developed techniques to dive inside and under the iceberg  such as heating pads on our kidneys with a battery that we dragged around so that  as the blood flowed through our kidneys it would get a little boost of warmth before going back into our bodies <unk>  but after three trips to antarctica i decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water <unk> and that same year ten years ago i headed north to <unk> the phoenix islands and i 'm going to tell you that story here in a moment but before i do i just want you to ponder this graph for a moment  you may have seen this in other forms but the top line is the amount of protected area on land <unk> globally <unk>  and it 's about twelve percent and you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up around the <unk> <unk> kind of a nice trajectory right now and that 's probably because that 's when everybody got aware of the environment and earth day and and all the stuff that happened in the ' 60s with the hippies and everything really did i think have an affect on global awareness <unk>  but the ocean protected area is basically flat line until right about now it appears to be ticking up and i do believe that we are at the hockey stick point of the protected area in the ocean i think we would have gotten there a lot earlier if we could see what happens in the ocean like <unk> we can see what happens on land <unk> but unfortunately the ocean is opaque <unk> and we can 't see what 's going on and therefore we 're way behind on protection but scuba diving submersibles and all the work that we 're setting about to do here will help rectify that so where are the phoenix islands <unk> they were the world <unk> area up until last week when the chagos archipelago was declared it 's in the mid pacific it 's about five days from anywhere if you want to get to the phoenix islands <unk> it 's five days from fiji it 's five days from hawaii it 's five days from samoa <unk> it 's out in the middle of the pacific right around the equator  i had never heard of the islands ten years ago nor the country kiribati that owns them till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in fiji said greg would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands they 've never been <unk> dived and i said yeah <unk> but tell me where they are and the country that owns them so that 's when i first learned of the islands and had no idea what i was getting into but i was in for the adventure let me give you a little peek here of the phoenix islands protected area  it 's a very <unk> deep water part of our planet <unk> the average depths are about twelve thousand ft there 's lots of seamounts in the phoenix islands which are specifically <unk> part of the protected area seamounts are important for biodiversity there 's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land it 's an interesting fact and the phoenix islands is very rich in those seamounts <unk>  so it 's a deep think about it in a big three dimensional space very deep three dimensional space with herds of tuna  <unk> all kinds of deep sea marine life like we 've seen here before that 's the vessel that we took up there for these studies early on <unk>  and that 's what the islands look like you can see in the background they 're very low to the water <unk> and they 're all uninhabited except one island has about thirty five caretakers on it  and they 've been uninhabited for most of time because even in the ancient days these islands were too far away from the bright lights of fiji and hawaii and and tahiti for those ancient polynesian mariners that <unk> were traversing the pacific so widely  but we got up there and i had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go okay where are we going to dive <unk>  let 's try there  and then falling into the water <unk> both my personal and my professional life changed suddenly i saw a world <unk> that i had never seen before in the ocean schools of fish that were so dense they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface  coral reefs that were continuous and solid and colorful large fish everywhere <unk> manta rays  it was an ecosystem parrotfish spawning this is about five thousand longnose parrotfish spawning at the entrance to one of the phoenix islands <unk>  you can see the fish are balled up and then there 's a little cloudy area there where they 're exchanging the eggs and sperm for <unk> reproduction events that the ocean is supposed to do <unk> but struggles to do in many places now because of human activity  the phoenix islands and and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here  phoenix islands is a major tuna location and sharks we had <unk> one hundred and fifty sharks at once which is an indication of a very very healthy very strong system <unk> so i thought the scenes of never ending wilderness would would go on forever but they did finally come to an end <unk> and we explored the surface of the islands as well very important bird nesting site some of the most important bird nesting sites in the pacific in the world <unk> and we finished our trip <unk> and that 's the the area again you can see the islands there are eight islands that pop out of the water the peaks that don 't come out of the water are the seamounts remember a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface <unk>  and what 's the context of the phoenix islands <unk> where do these exist well they exist in the republic of kiribati <unk> and kiribati is located in the central pacific in three island groups in the west we have the gilbert islands  in the center we have the phoenix islands which is the subject that i 'm talking about and then over to the east we have the line islands <unk> it 's the largest atoll nation in the world <unk>  and they have about one hundred and ten thousand people spread out over thirty three islands <unk> they control three point four million cubic <unk> that 's between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet <unk>  and when i was first going up there i barely knew the name of this country ten years ago and people would ask me why are you going to this place called kiribati and it reminded me of that old joke where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed and the reporter yells hey <unk> willy why do you rob banks  and he says cause that 's where all the money is  and i would tell people why do <unk> because that 's where all the ocean is they basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the central pacific ocean  they 're also a country that is in dire danger  sea levels are rising <unk> and kiribati along with forty two other nations in the world will be under water within fifty to one hundred years due to climate change and the associated <unk> <unk> rise from thermal expansion and the melting of freshwater into the ocean the islands rise only one to two meters above the surface <unk> some of the islands have already gone under water <unk> and these nations are faced with a real problem we as a world are faced with a problem what do we do with displaced fellow earthlings who no longer have a home on the planet <unk>  the president of the maldives conducted a mock cabinet meeting underwater recently <unk> highlight the dire straits of these countries so it 's something we need to focus on <unk>  but back to the phoenix islands which is the subject of this talk  after i got back i said okay <unk>  this is amazing what we found i 'd like to go back and share it with the government of kiribati who are over in tarawa the westernmost group <unk>  <unk> started contacting them because they had actually given me a permit to do this and i said i want to come up and tell you what we found and for some reason they didn 't want me to come or it was hard to find a time and a place and it took a while but finally they said okay you can come but if you come you have to buy lunch for everybody who comes to the seminar so i said okay i 'm happy to buy lunch just get whatever anybody wants so david obura a coral reef biologist and i went to tarawa <unk> and we presented for two hours on the amazing findings of the phoenix islands and the country never never knew this they never had any data from this area they 'd never had any information from the phoenix islands <unk> after the talk the minister of fisheries walked up to me and he said greg <unk> do you realize that you are the first scientist who has ever come back and told us what they did he said we often issue these permits to do research in our waters but usually we get a note two or three years later <unk> or a <unk> the first one who 's ever come back and told us what you did and we really appreciate that and we 're buying you lunch today <unk> and are you free for dinner  and i was free for dinner <unk> and i went out to dinner with the minister of fisheries in kiribati <unk> and over the course of dinner i learned that kiribati gains most of its revenue it 's a very poor country but it gains what revenue is has by selling access to foreign nations to take fish out of its waters because kiribati does not have the capacity to take the fish itself and the deal that they strike is the extracting country gives kiribati five percent of the landed value  so if the united states removes a million dollars ' worth of lobsters from a reef kiribati gets fifty thousand dollars <unk> and you know it didn 't seem like a very good deal to me <unk> so i asked the minister over <unk> over dinner i said would you consider a situation where you would still get paid we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is but you leave fish and the <unk> and the sharks and the shrimp in the water he stopped and he said yes we would like to do that to deal with our overfishing problem <unk> and i think we would call it a reverse fishing license he coined the term reverse fishing license so i said <unk> license ' so we walked away from this dinner really not knowing where to go at that point i went back to the states and started looking around to see if i could find examples where reverse fishing licenses had been issued and it turned out there were none there were no oceanic deals where countries were compensated for not fishing it had occurred on land in rainforests of <unk> south america and africa where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down and conservation international had struck some of those deals so i went to conservation international and brought them in as a partner and and went through the process of valuing the fishery resource deciding how much kiribati should be <unk> what the range of the fishes were brought in a whole bunch of other partners the government of australia the government of new zealand the world bank the oak foundation and national geographic have been big funders of this as well <unk>  and we basically founded the park on the idea of an endowment that would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees to this to this very poor country to keep the area intact <unk>  halfway through this process i met the president of kiribati <unk> president anote tong he 's a really important leader a forward thinking man and he told me two things when i approached him he said greg <unk> there 's two things i 'd like you to do  one is remember i 'm a politician so you 've got to go out and work with my ministers and convince the people of kiribati that this is a good idea  secondly i 'd like you to create principles that will transcend my own presidency <unk>  i don 't want to do something like this if it 's going to go away after i 'm voted out of office  so we had very strong leadership very good vision <unk> and a lot of science a lot of lawyers involved many many steps were taken to pull this off <unk>  and it was primarily because kiribati realized that this was in their own self interest to do this they realized that this was a common cause that they had found with the conservation community then in two thousand and two when this was all going full swing a <unk> coral bleaching event happened in the phoenix <unk> islands <unk> here 's this resource that we 're looking to save and it turns out it 's the hottest heating event that we can find on record the ocean heated up as it does sometimes and the hot spot formed and stalled right over the phoenix islands for six months it was over thirty two degrees celsius for six months and it basically killed sixty percent of the coral so <unk> suddenly we had this area that we were protecting but now it it appeared to be dead at least in the coral areas of course the deep sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine but the coral which everybody likes to look at was in trouble  well <unk> the good news is it 's recovered and recovering fast faster than any reef we 've seen this picture was just taken by brian skerry a few months ago when we returned to the phoenix islands and discovered that because it is a protected area and has <unk> healthy fish populations that keep the algae grazed down and keep the rest of the reef healthy the coral is booming is just booming back it 's almost like if a person has multiple diseases <unk>  it 's hard to get well you might die but if you only have one disease to deal with you can get better <unk> and that 's the story <unk> 's the only threat the only influence that the reef had to deal with there was no fishing there was no pollution there was no coastal development  and the reef is on a full bore recovery  now i remember that dinner i had with the minister of fisheries ten years ago when we first brought this up and i got quite animated during the dinner and said well i think that the conservation community might embrace this idea minister he paused and put his hands together and said yes greg <unk> but the devil will be in the details <unk> and it certainly was the last ten years have been detail after detail ranging from creating legislation to multiple research expeditions to communication plans  as i said <unk> teams of lawyers <unk> mous creating the phoenix islands trust board and we are now in the process <unk> of raising the full endowment kiribati has frozen extracting activities at its current state while we raise the endowment we just had our first pipa trust board meeting three weeks ago <unk> so it 's a fully functional <unk> up and running entity that negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country and the pipa trust board holds that license and pays the country for this so it 's a very solid very well thought out very well grounded <unk> that was very important with this work from the bottom up to to secure this  so the conditions for success here are listed you can read them yourselves but i would say the most important one in my mind was working within the market forces of the situation <unk> and that insured that we could move this forward and it would have both the self interest of kiribati <unk> as well as the self interest of the world and i 'll leave you with one final slide  that is how do we scale this up how do we realize sylvia 's dream where eventually do we take this here 's the pacific with large mpas and large conservation zones on it and as you can see we have a patchwork across this ocean i 've just described to you the one story behind that rectangular area in the middle the phoenix islands <unk> but every other green patch on that has its own story and what we need to do now is look at the whole pacific ocean in its entirety and make a network of mpas across the pacific so that we have our world 's largest ocean protected and
