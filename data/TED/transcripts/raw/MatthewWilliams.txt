people like me were shunned and hidden away <unk> there has been lots of change since special olympics began in <unk> many cases <unk> people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider population  people use the r word in front of me and they think it doesn 't matter  that 's the word retard or retarded used in a derogatory <unk> they 're not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends <unk>  i don 't want you to think i 'm here because i 'm a charity case <unk> i am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people see individuals with intellectual disabilities or too often how they don 't see them at all  did you know the world games happened this year <unk> i was one of over six thousand five hundred athletes with intellectual disabilities from one hundred and sixty five countries who competed in la  there was over sixty two thousand spectators watching opening ceremonies <unk> and there was live coverage on tsn and <unk> did you even know that happened <unk> what do you think of when you see someone like me  i am here today to challenge you to look at us as equals  special olympics transforms the self identity of athletes with

sports didn 't have many friends and felt left out and sad  there was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were <unk> hidden away from society <unk>  no one thought they could participate in sports let alone be a valued member of society <unk>  <unk> frank hayden a scientist at the university of toronto was studying the effects of regular exercise on the fitness levels of children with intellectual disabilities <unk>  using rigorous scientific research dr hayden and other researchers came to the conclusion that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused their fitness levels to suffer  <unk> lots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competition opportunities <unk>  but pioneers like dr hayden and eunice kennedy shriver <unk> the founder of special olympics <unk> persevered <unk> and special olympics athletes have proved them right four and a half <unk> before i joined special olympics <unk> i was nervous because i was young <unk> shy not confident and didn 't have many friends  when i got there though everyone was very encouraging <unk> supportive and let me be myself

doctor or accessing health care  at the two thousand and fifteen world summer games my team canada teammates and i played the nigerian basketball team  the day before our game the nigerian basketball team went to the world games healthy athlete screening <unk> where seven of ten members <unk> were given hearing aids for free and got to hear clearly for the first time <unk> them was amazing they were more excited <unk> happy and confident because their coach could vocally communicate with them  and they were emotional because they could hear the sounds of the basketball the sounds of the whistle and the cheering fans in the stands sounds that we take for granted  special olympics <unk> is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport <unk> special olympics is transforming their lives off the field  this year <unk> research findings showed that nearly half of the adults in the us don 't know a single person with an intellectual disability <unk> <unk> percent of americans who don 't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less accepting and positive <unk>  then there 's the r word proving that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people  people use it as a casual term or an insult it was tweeted more than nine million times <unk> last year <unk> and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the planet <unk> people don 't think it 's insulting <unk> but it is  as my fellow athlete and global messenger john franklin stephens wrote in an
