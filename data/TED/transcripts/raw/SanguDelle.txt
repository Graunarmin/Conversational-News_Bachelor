 <unk> it was my first time eating nigerian <unk> through a lot of personal turmoil faced with enormous stress <unk> i suffered an anxiety attack  on some days <unk> i could do no work on other days <unk> i just wanted to lay in my bed and cry my doctor asked if i 'd like to speak with a mental health professional about my stress and <unk> anxiety mental health <unk> i clammed up and violently shook my head in protest <unk>  i felt a profound sense of a shame <unk> i felt the weight of stigma <unk> i have a loving supportive family and incredibly loyal friends <unk> i could not entertain the idea of speaking to anyone about my feeling of pain <unk> i felt suffocated by the rigid architecture of our african masculinity people have real problems sangu get over yourself  <unk> i was a boarding school student fresh off the boat from ghana at the peddie school in new jersey <unk>  i had just gone through the brutal experience of losing seven loved ones in the same month  the school nurse concerned about what i 'd gone through god bless her soul she inquired about my <unk> i thought  does she not know i 'm an african man  like okonkwo in things fall apart we african men neither process nor express our emotions <unk>  we deal with our problems  we deal with our problems <unk> i called my brother and laughed about <unk> growing up in west africa <unk> when people used the term mental what came to mind was a madman with dirty dread locked hair <unk> bumbling around half naked on the streets <unk>  we all know this man our parents warned us about him  <unk> if you even look at drugs you end up like him  come down with pneumonia and your mother will rush you to the nearest hospital for medical treatment <unk>  but dare to declare depression and your local pastor will be driving out demons and blaming witches in your village according to the world health organization mental health is about being able to <unk> cope with the normal stressors of life to work productively and fruitfully and to be able to make a contribution to your community mental health includes our emotional psychological and social <unk> yet most african governments invest less than one percent of their health care budget in mental health even worse <unk> we have a severe shortage of psychiatrists in africa <unk> nigeria for example is estimated to have two hundred in a country of almost two hundred million in all of <unk> africa <unk> ninety percent of our people lack access to treatment as a result we suffer in solitude silenced by stigma <unk> we as africans often respond to mental health with distance  <unk> what is the cause of mental illness thirty four percent of nigerian respondents cited drug misuse <unk> nineteen percent said divine wrath and the will of god <unk> twelve percent  witchcraft and spiritual possession  but few cited other known causes of mental illness like genetics  socioeconomic status <unk> war <unk>  conflict or the loss of a loved one the stigmatization against mental illness often results <unk> in the ostracizing and demonizing of sufferers <unk> photojournalist robin hammond has documented some of these abuses in uganda  in somalia  and here in nigeria <unk>  for me the stigma is personal  in two thousand and <unk> nine i received a frantic call in the middle of the night my best friend in the world a brilliant <unk> philosophical charming hip young man was diagnosed with schizophrenia <unk> i witnessed some of the friends we 'd <unk> demeaning commentary about his condition words we would never say about someone with cancer or someone with malaria <unk>  <unk> when it comes to mental illness our ignorance eviscerates all empathy <unk> i stood by his side as his community isolated him <unk> but our love never wavered  tacitly i became passionate about mental health <unk>  inspired by his plight <unk> i helped found the mental health special interest alumni group at my college and during my <unk> tenure as a resident tutor in graduate school i supported many undergraduates with their mental health challenges <unk> i saw african students struggle and unable to speak to anyone even with this knowledge and with their stories in tow i in turn struggled and could not speak to anyone when i faced my own anxiety so deep is our fear <unk> fear of being the madman  all of us but we africans especially need to realize that our mental struggles do not detract from our virility  nor does our trauma taint our strength <unk>  we need to see mental health as important as physical health <unk> we need to stop suffering in silence <unk> we must stop stigmatizing disease and traumatizing the afflicted  talk to your friends <unk> talk to your loved ones talk to health professionals <unk> be vulnerable do so with the confidence that you are not alone speak up if you 're struggling  being honest about how we feel does not make us weak it makes us human  it is time to end the stigma associated with mental illness so the next time your hear mental do not just think of the madman think of me
