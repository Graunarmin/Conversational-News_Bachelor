 <unk> we live in an incredibly busy world <unk> the pace of life is often frantic our minds are always busy and we 're always doing something  so with that in mind i 'd like you just to take a moment to think when did you last take any time to do nothing  just ten minutes undisturbed <unk> and when i say nothing i do mean nothing so that 's no emailing texting no internet no tv no chatting no eating no reading  not even sitting there reminiscing about the past or planning for the future <unk> simply doing nothing <unk> i see a lot of very blank faces <unk> probably have to go a long way back and this is an extraordinary thing right we 're talking about our mind  the mind our most valuable and precious resource through which we experience every single moment of our life <unk>  the mind that we rely upon to be happy  content <unk> emotionally stable as individuals and at the same time to be kind and thoughtful and considerate in our relationships with others  this is the same mind that we depend upon to be focused creative <unk> spontaneous and to perform at our very best in everything that we do  and yet we don 't take any time out to look after it in fact we spend more time looking after our cars our clothes and our hair than we okay maybe not our hair but you see where i 'm going <unk> the result of course is that we get stressed <unk> you know the mind whizzes away like a <unk> washing machine going round and round lots of difficult confusing emotions <unk> and we don 't really know how to deal with that and the sad fact is that we are so distracted that we 're no longer present in the world in which we live we miss out on the things that are most important <unk> the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes that 's the way life is so we 've just kind of got to get on with it that 's really not how it has to be so i was about eleven when i went along to my first meditation class  and trust me it had all the stereotypes that you can imagine the sitting <unk> cross legged on the floor <unk>  the incense <unk> the herbal tea the vegetarians the whole deal <unk> but my mom was going and i was intrigued so i went along with her i 'd also seen a few kung fu movies and secretly i kind of thought i might be <unk> to learn how to fly but i was very young at the time <unk> now as i was there <unk> i guess like a lot of people i assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind you get stressed you do some meditation i hadn 't really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature  until i was about twenty when a number of things happened in my <unk> life in quite quick succession  really serious things which just flipped my life upside down and all of a sudden i was inundated with thoughts  inundated with difficult emotions that i didn 't know how to cope with every time i sort of pushed one down another one would pop back up again it was a really very stressful time  i guess we all deal with stress in different ways <unk> some people will bury themselves in work grateful for the the distraction others will turn to their friends their family <unk> for support <unk> some people hit the bottle start taking medication  my own way of dealing with it was to become a monk <unk>  so i quit my degree <unk> i headed off to the himalayas i became a monk and i started studying meditation  people often ask me what i learned from that time <unk> well <unk>  <unk> 's face it <unk> becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things but it was more than that it taught me it gave me a greater appreciation an understanding for the present moment by that i mean not being lost in thought not being distracted not being overwhelmed by difficult emotions <unk> but <unk> instead learning how to be in the here and now how to be mindful how to be present  i think the present moment is so underrated it sounds so ordinary <unk> and yet we spend so little time in the present moment that it 's anything but ordinary there was a research paper that came out of harvard just recently that said on average our minds are lost in thought almost <unk> this sort of constant mind wandering is also a direct cause of unhappiness now we 're not here for that long anyway <unk> but to spend almost half of our life lost in thought and potentially quite unhappy i don 't know it just kind of seems tragic actually especially when there 's something we can do about it <unk> when there 's a positive practical <unk> achievable scientifically proven technique which allows our mind to be more healthy to be more mindful and less distracted <unk> and the beauty of it is that even though it need only take about ten minutes a day it impacts our entire life <unk>  but we need to know how to do it we need an exercise we need a framework to learn how to be more mindful that 's essentially <unk> what meditation is it 's familiarizing ourselves with the present moment but we also need to know how to approach it in the right way to get the best from it and that 's what these are for in case you 've been wondering because most people assume that meditation is all about stopping thoughts <unk> getting rid of emotions somehow controlling the mind but actually <unk> 's quite different from that it 's more about stepping back  sort of seeing the thought clearly <unk> witnessing it coming and going emotions coming and going without judgment  but with a relaxed focused mind <unk>  so for example right now if i focus too much on the balls then there 's no way i can relax and talk to you at the same time equally if i relax too much talking to <unk> there 's no way i can focus on the balls i 'm going to drop them  now in life <unk> and in meditation there 'll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense and life starts to feel a bit like this it 's a very uncomfortable way to live life when you get this tight and stressed  at other times we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much and things just become a sort of little bit like this of course in meditation <unk> end up falling asleep <unk> so we 're looking for a balance a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go without all the usual involvement now what usually happens when we 're learning to be mindful is that we get distracted by a thought let 's say this is an anxious thought everything 's going fine and we see the anxious thought oh i didn 't realize i was worried about that  <unk> this is crazy we do this all the time even on an everyday level if you think about the last time you had a wobbly tooth <unk> you know it 's wobbly and you know that it hurts <unk> but what do you <unk> and we reinforce the storyline <unk> right and we just keep telling ourselves <unk> and we do it all the time and it 's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those storylines and patterns of mind <unk>  but when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way <unk> you might see many different patterns you might find a mind that 's really restless and the whole time <unk> don 't be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that  you might find a mind that 's very dull and boring and it 's just almost mechanical it just seems it 's as if you <unk> 're getting up going to work <unk> eat <unk> sleep get up  or it might just be that one little nagging thought that just goes round and round <unk> offers the opportunity the potential to step back and to get a different perspective to see that things aren 't always as they appear <unk> we can 't change every little thing that happens to us in life <unk>  but we can change the way that we experience it that 's the potential of meditation of mindfulness <unk> don 't have to burn any incense <unk> and you definitely don 't have to sit on the floor all you need to do is to take ten minutes out a day to step back to familiarize yourself with the present moment so that you get to experience a greater sense of focus  calm and clarity in your life thank you very much
