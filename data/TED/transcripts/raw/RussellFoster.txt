 <unk> what i 'd like to do today is talk about one of my favorite subjects <unk> and that is the neuroscience of sleep <unk> to most of us and of course it 's the sound of the alarm clock <unk> and what that truly ghastly awful sound does is stop the single most important behavioral experience that we have and that 's sleep <unk> if you 're an average sort of person thirty six percent of your life will be spent asleep <unk> which means that if you live to ninety then <unk> years will have been spent entirely asleep <unk>  now what that thirty two years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important <unk> and yet for most of us we don 't give sleep a second thought  we throw it away we really just don 't think about sleep and so what i 'd like to do today is change your views <unk> change your ideas and your thoughts <unk> thoughts about sleep and the journey that i want to take you on <unk> we need to start by going back in time  enjoy the <unk> honey heavy dew of slumber any ideas who said that  shakespeare 's julius caesar <unk> yes let me give you a few more <unk> o gentle sleep <unk> nature 's soft nurse how have i frighted thee shakespeare again from i won 't say it the scottish play  from the same time sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together extremely prophetic by thomas dekker <unk> another elizabethan dramatist <unk>  but if we jump forward four hundred years the tone about sleep <unk> changes somewhat this is from thomas edison from the beginning of the 20th century sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days bang  and if we also jump into the 1980s some of you may remember that margaret thatcher was reported to have said sleep is for wimps  and of course the infamous what was his name <unk> the infamous gordon gekko from <unk> wall street said money never sleeps what do we do in the 20th century about sleep <unk> well <unk> of course <unk> we use thomas edison 's light bulb to invade the night <unk> and we occupied the dark <unk> and in the process of this occupation we 've treated sleep as an illness <unk> almost we 've treated it as an enemy an enemy <unk> we tolerate the need for sleep and at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep as an illness that needs some sort of a cure  and our ignorance ignorance about sleep is really quite profound <unk>  why is it why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts well it 's because you don 't do anything much while you 're asleep it seems <unk> you don 't eat you <unk> most of us anyway <unk> and so therefore it 's sorry <unk> it 's a complete waste of time right wrong  actually sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology <unk> and neuroscientists are beginning to explain why it 's so very important <unk> so let 's move to the brain <unk>  now here we have a brain <unk>  this is donated by a social <unk> scientist <unk> and they said they didn 't know what it was or indeed how to use it so sorry  so i borrowed it i don 't think they noticed <unk> ok  the point i 'm trying to make is that when you 're asleep this <unk> thing doesn 't shut down in fact some areas of the brain are actually more active during the sleep state than during the wake state <unk>  the other thing that 's really important about sleep is that it doesn 't arise from a single structure within the brain <unk>  but is to some extent a network property if we flip the brain on its back i love this little bit of spinal cord here this bit here is the hypothalamus <unk> and right under there <unk> a whole raft of interesting structures not least the biological clock the biological clock tells us when it 's good to be up <unk> when it 's good to be asleep <unk> and what that structure does is interact with a whole raft of other areas within the hypothalamus the lateral hypothalamus the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei all of those combine and they send projections down to the brain stem here <unk> the brain stem then projects forward and bathes the cortex this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here with neurotransmitters that keep us <unk> awake and essentially provide us with our consciousness <unk>  so sleep arises from a whole raft of different interactions within the brain <unk> and essentially sleep is turned on and off as a result of a range of interactions in here <unk>  ok <unk> so where have we got to we 've said that sleep is complicated and it takes <unk> of our life but what i haven 't explained is what sleep is about so why do we sleep  and it won 't surprise any of you that of course as scientists we don 't have a consensus there are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep  and i 'm going to outline three of those the first is sort of the restoration idea and it 's somewhat intuitive essentially <unk> all the stuff we 've burned during the day <unk> we restore we replace we rebuild during the night <unk> and indeed as an explanation <unk> it goes back to aristotle so that 's what two thousand three hundred years ago it 's gone in and out of fashion it 's fashionable at the moment because what 's been shown is that within the brain a whole raft of genes have been shown to be turned on only during sleep <unk> and those genes are associated with restoration and metabolic pathways <unk> so there 's good <unk> evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis <unk> what about energy conservation again <unk> perhaps intuitive you essentially sleep to save calories <unk> now <unk> when you do the sums though it doesn 't really pan out if you compare an individual who has slept at night <unk> or stayed awake and hasn 't moved very much  the energy saving of sleeping is about one hundred and ten calories a night <unk> now that 's the equivalent of a hot dog bun <unk> bun now i would say that a hot dog bun is kind of a meager return for such a complicated and demanding behavior as sleep <unk> so i 'm less convinced by the the energy conservation idea <unk>  but the third idea i 'm quite attracted to which is brain processing and memory consolidation what we know is that if after you 've tried to learn a task and you <unk> ability to learn that task is smashed <unk> it 's really hugely attenuated <unk> so sleep and memory consolidation is also very important <unk> however <unk> it 's not just the laying down of memory and recalling it  what 's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep in fact it 's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage <unk> sleeping at night enhances our creativity and what seems to be going on is that in the brain <unk> those neural connections that are important those synaptic connections that are important are linked <unk> and strengthened while those that are less important tend to fade away and be less important <unk>  <unk> vary and it 's probable we sleep for multiple different reasons <unk> but sleep is not an indulgence <unk> it 's not some sort of thing that we can take on board rather casually <unk> i think that sleep was once likened to an upgrade from economy to business class you know the equivalent of <unk> <unk> it 's not even an upgrade from economy to first class <unk> the critical thing to realize is that <unk> 't sleep <unk>  you don 't fly  essentially you never get there  and what 's extraordinary about much of our society these days is that we are desperately sleep deprived so let 's now look at sleep deprivation <unk>  huge sectors of society are sleep deprived and let 's look at our sleep o meter  <unk> good data suggests that most of us were getting around eight hours of sleep a night <unk> nowadays <unk> we sleep one and a half to two hours less every night <unk> so we 're in the <unk> league  for teenagers <unk> it 's worse much worse they need nine hours for full brain performance <unk> and many of them on a school night <unk> are only getting five hours of sleep <unk> it 's simply not enough  if we think about other sectors of society the aged are aged then your ability to sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted and many sleep <unk> again less than five hours a night shift work shift work is extraordinary <unk>  perhaps twenty percent of the working population <unk> and the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night <unk> it 's locked onto the same light dark cycle as the rest of us so when the poor old shift worker is going home to try and sleep during the day desperately tired <unk> body clock is saying wake up this is the time to be awake so the quality of sleep <unk> that you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor again in that sort of <unk> five hour region <unk>  and then of course <unk> tens of millions of people suffer from jet lag <unk> so who here has jet lag <unk> well <unk> my goodness gracious <unk> well thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep because that 's what your brain is craving one of the things that the <unk> brain does is indulge in this involuntary falling asleep <unk> and you have essentially no control over it now micro sleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing <unk> but they can also be deadly <unk>  it 's been estimated that thirty one percent of drivers will fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life and in the us the statistics are pretty good one hundred thousand accidents on the freeway have been associated with tiredness loss of vigilance and falling asleep a hundred thousand a year it 's extraordinary  at another level of terror <unk> we dip into the tragic accidents at chernobyl and indeed the space shuttle challenger which was so tragically lost <unk>  and in the investigations that followed those <unk> poor judgment as a result of extended shift work and loss of vigilance and tiredness was attributed to a big chunk of of those those disasters <unk>  when you 're tired and you lack sleep you have poor memory you have poor creativity <unk> you have increased impulsiveness and you have overall poor judgment but my friends <unk> it 's so much <unk> the brain is craving things to wake it up <unk> so drugs stimulants caffeine represents the stimulant of choice across much of the western world <unk> much of the day is fueled by caffeine and if you 're a really naughty tired brain <unk> nicotine of course you 're fueling the waking state with these <unk> what do we do about that when i 'm feeling completely wired well of course you then resort to alcohol now alcohol short term you know once or twice to use to mildly sedate you can be very useful it can actually ease the the sleep transition <unk> but what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesn 't provide sleep a biological mimic for sleep it sedates you so it actually harms some of <unk> processing that 's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall <unk> so it 's a <unk> short term acute measure <unk> but for goodness sake don 't become addicted to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night <unk>  another connection between loss loss of sleep is weight gain <unk>  if you sleep around about five hours or less every night <unk> then you have a fifty percent likelihood of being obese what 's the connection here <unk> well <unk> sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin <unk> the hunger hormone ghrelin is released <unk>  it gets gets to the brain <unk> the brain says i need carbohydrates and what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars <unk> so there 's a link between tiredness and the metabolic predisposition for weight gain  <unk> and one of the things of stress of course is loss of memory which is what i sort of just then had a little lapse of but stress is so much more <unk> so <unk> <unk> if you 're acutely stressed not a great problem <unk>  but it 's sustained stress associated with sleep loss that 's the problem sustained stress leads to suppressed immunity <unk> and so tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection and there 's some very good studies <unk> showing that shift workers for example have higher rates of cancer <unk> increased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation glucose becomes a dominant part of the vasculature and essentially you become glucose intolerant <unk> therefore <unk> diabetes two  stress increases cardiovascular disease <unk> raising blood pressure <unk> so there 's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss that are more than just a mildly impaired brain which is where i think most people think that sleep sleep loss resides <unk> so at this point in the talk <unk> this is a nice time to think well <unk> do you think on the whole i 'm getting enough sleep  so a quick show of hands who feels that they 're getting enough sleep here oh well <unk> talk more about that later about what are your tips <unk> so most of us of course <unk>  ask the question how do i know whether i 'm getting enough sleep well <unk> it 's not rocket science <unk> if you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning <unk> if you are taking a long time to get up <unk> if you need lots of stimulants if you 're grumpy if you 're irritable <unk> if you 're told by your work colleagues that you 're looking tired and irritable <unk> chances are you are <unk> this is slightly offensive sleep for dummies  make your bedroom a haven for sleep <unk>  the first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can and also make it slightly cool very important actually  reduce your amount of light exposure at least half an hour before you go to bed light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep what 's the last thing that most of us do before we go to bed we <unk> in a massively lit bathroom looking into the mirror cleaning our teeth it 's the worst thing we can possibly do before we go to sleep <unk>  turn off those mobile phones turn off those computers <unk> turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain <unk> try not to drink caffeine too late in the day <unk> ideally not after lunch <unk> set about reducing light exposure before you go to bed <unk> but light exposure in the morning is very good at setting the biological clock to the light dark cycle <unk> so seek out morning light  basically <unk> listen to yourself <unk>  wind down do those sorts of things that you know are going to ease you off into the into the honey heavy dew of slumber <unk>  ok <unk> that 's some facts what about some myths teenagers <unk> poor things they have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late so give them a break <unk> we need eight hours of sleep a night <unk>  that 's an average some people need more some people need less and what you need to do is listen to your body do you need that much or do you need more simple as that  old people need less sleep not true  the sleep demands of the aged do not go down essentially sleep fragments and becomes less robust <unk> but sleep requirements do not go down <unk>  and the fourth myth is early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy <unk> wealthy and wise well that 's wrong at so many different levels  laughter there is no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early gives you more wealth at all there 's no difference in socioeconomic status  in my experience <unk> only difference between morning people and evening people is that those people that get up in the morning early are just horribly smug  ok <unk>  so for the last few minutes what i want to do is change gears and talk about some really new breaking areas of neuroscience which is the association between mental health mental illness and sleep disruption we 've known for one hundred and thirty years that in severe mental illness there is always always sleep disruption but it 's been largely ignored in the <unk> 1970s when people started to think about this again they said yes well of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia <unk> because they 're on antipsychotics <unk> it 's the antipsychotics causing <unk> the fact that for a hundred years previously  sleep disruption had been reported before antipsychotics <unk> so what 's going on several groups are studying conditions like depression schizophrenia and bipolar and what 's going on in terms of sleep disruption we have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia  <unk> and the data were quite extraordinary in those individuals with schizophrenia <unk>  <unk> they were awake during the night phase and then they were asleep during the day <unk> other groups showed no 24 hour patterns whatsoever their sleep was absolutely smashed <unk> and some had no ability to regulate their sleep by the light dark cycle they were getting up later and later and later and later each night <unk> it was smashed <unk>  so what 's going on  and the really exciting news is that mental illness and <unk> sleep are not simply associated <unk>  but they are physically linked within the brain <unk> the neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep give you normal sleep and those that give you normal mental health are overlapping <unk>  and what 's the evidence for that <unk> well <unk> genes that have been shown to be very important in the generation of normal <unk> when mutated when changed also predispose individuals to mental health problems  and last year we published a study which showed that a gene that 's been linked to schizophrenia <unk> when mutated also smashes the sleep <unk> so we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap between these two important systems <unk>  other work flowed from these studies <unk> the first was that sleep disruption actually precedes certain types of mental illness <unk> and we 've shown that in those young individuals who are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder they already have a sleep abnormality prior to any clinical diagnosis of of bipolar  the other bit of data was that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate make <unk> mental illness state my colleague dan freeman has used a range of agents which have stabilized sleep and reduced levels of paranoia in those individuals by fifty percent so what have we got <unk> we 've got <unk> in these connections some really exciting things  in terms of the neuroscience by understanding these two systems we 're really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness are generated and regulated within the brain <unk>  the second area is that if we can use sleep and sleep disruption as an early warning signal then we have the chance of going in if we know these individuals are vulnerable early intervention then becomes possible <unk> and the third which i think is the most exciting is that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain as a new therapeutic target <unk> stabilize sleep in those individuals <unk> who are vulnerable we can certainly make them healthier <unk> but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness <unk> so let me just finish what i started by saying is  take sleep seriously our attitudes toward sleep are so very different from a pre industrial age when we were almost wrapped in a duvet we used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep and this isn 't some sort of crystal waving nonsense this is a pragmatic response to good health <unk> if you have good sleep <unk> increases your concentration attention decision making creativity <unk> social skills health <unk> if you get sleep <unk> it reduces your mood changes your stress your levels <unk> <unk> of anger your impulsivity and your tendency to drink and take drugs <unk> and we finished by saying <unk> illness and indeed is providing us new ways to treat these incredibly debilitating conditions <unk>  jim butcher <unk> the fantasy writer said sleep is god go worship and i can only recommend that you do the same <unk> thank you
