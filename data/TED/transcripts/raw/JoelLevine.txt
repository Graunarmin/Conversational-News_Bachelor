 <unk> four point six billion years of history in eighteen minutes  that 's three hundred million years per minute <unk> let 's start with the first photograph <unk> the new york times wrote in its editorial  mars is uninteresting it 's a dead world nasa should not spend any time or effort studying mars anymore  <unk> leaders in washington at nasa headquarters knew better and we began a very extensive study of the red planet  one of the key questions in all of science is there life outside of earth  i believe that mars is the most likely target for life outside the earth i 'm going to show you in a few minutes some amazing measurements that suggest there may be life on mars <unk>  but let me start with <unk> viking photograph this is a composite taken by viking in <unk> viking was developed and managed at the nasa langley research center <unk> we sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of one thousand nine <unk> we had four spacecraft two around mars <unk> two on the surface an amazing accomplishment <unk> this is the first photograph taken <unk> from the surface of any planet this is a viking lander photograph of the surface of mars <unk> and yes the red planet is red  mars is half the size of the earth but because two thirds of the earth is covered by water <unk> the land area on mars is comparable to the land area on earth so mars is a pretty big place even though it 's <unk> have obtained topographic measurements of the surface of mars <unk> we understand the elevation differences we know a lot about mars mars has <unk> the largest volcano in the solar system <unk> olympus mons mars has the grand canyon of the solar system valles marineris <unk>  <unk> interesting planet mars has the largest impact crater in the solar system <unk> hellas basin <unk> this is two thousand miles across <unk> if you happened to be on mars when this impactor hit <unk> it was a really bad day on mars  this is olympus mons <unk> this is bigger than the state of arizona <unk> volcanoes are important because volcanoes produce atmospheres and they produce oceans <unk> looking at valles marineris <unk> the largest canyon in the solar system superimposed on a map of the united states three thousand miles across one of the most <unk> <unk> intriguing features about mars the national academy of science says one of the ten major mysteries of the <unk> on mars where for some reason we don 't understand why at this point the surface is very very highly magnetized  is there water on mars <unk> the answer is no there is no liquid water on the surface of mars today  but there is intriguing evidence that suggests that the early history of mars there may have been rivers and fast flowing water <unk> today mars is very very dry we believe there 's some water in the polar caps there are polar caps of north pole and south pole here are some recent images this is from spirit and opportunity these images that show at one time there was very fast flowing water on the surface of mars <unk> why is water important  water is important because if you want life you have to have water <unk> water is the key ingredient in the evolution the origin of life on a planet <unk>  here is some picture of antarctica and a picture of olympus mons <unk> very similar features glaciers <unk> so this is frozen water this is ice water on mars <unk>  this is my favorite picture this <unk> just taken a few weeks ago it has not been seen publicly <unk> this is european space agency mars express <unk> image of a crater on mars and in the middle of the crater we have liquid water we have ice very intriguing photograph <unk>  we now believe that in the early history of mars which is four point six billion years ago  four point six billion years ago mars <unk> mars had rivers mars had lakes but more important mars had we believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere <unk> and this area in blue which shows a depression of about four miles was the ancient ocean area on the surface of mars <unk>  where did the ocean 's worth of water on mars go <unk> we have an idea <unk> this is a measurement we obtained a few years ago from a mars orbiting satellite called odyssey <unk> <unk> water on mars <unk> frozen in the form of ice <unk>  and this shows the percent if it 's a blueish color it means sixteen percent by weight <unk> sixteen percent by weight of the interior contains frozen water or ice <unk> <unk> a lot of water below the surface <unk>  the most intriguing and puzzling measurement in my opinion <unk> we 've obtained of mars <unk> was released earlier this year in the magazine science and what we 're looking at is the presence of the gas methane in the atmosphere of mars <unk> and you can see there are three distinct regions of methane why is methane important <unk> because on earth <unk> almost all ninety nine point nine percent of the methane is produced by living systems not little green men <unk>  but microscopic life below the surface or at the surface <unk> we now have evidence that methane is in the atmosphere of mars <unk> a gas that on earth is biogenic in origin <unk> produced by living systems <unk> these are the three plumes a and this is the terrain it appears over and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on mars in fact  the earth and mars are both four point six billion years old  the oldest rock on earth is only three point six billion the reason there gap in our geological understanding is because of plate tectonics the crust of the earth has been recycled we have no geological record prior for the first billion years  that record exists on mars and this terrain that we 're looking at dates back to four point six billion <unk> this is a map that shows where we 've put our spacecraft on the surface of mars <unk> here is viking i viking ii this is opportunity <unk> <unk> this is spirit this is mars pathfinder <unk> this is phoenix we just put two years ago <unk>  <unk> hemisphere that 's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin there aren 't many craters <unk> and that 's because the water protected the the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites but look in the southern hemisphere in the southern hemisphere there are impact craters there are volcanic craters <unk> here 's hellas basin <unk> a very very different place geologically look where the methane is the methane is in a very rough terrain area <unk>  what is the best way to unravel the mysteries on mars that exist <unk> we asked this question ten years ago <unk> we invited ten of the top mars scientists to the langley research center for two <unk> days we addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered <unk>  and we spent two days deciding how to best answer this question and the result of our meeting was a robotic <unk> there 's a model of ares here this is a 20 percent scale model this airplane was designed at the langley research center if any place in the world can build an airplane to fly on mars <unk> it 's the langley research center  for almost one hundred years a leading center of aeronautics in the world <unk>  we fly about a mile above the surface <unk> we cover hundreds of miles <unk> and we fly about four hundred and fifty miles an hour <unk>  we can do things that rovers can 't do and landers can 't do we can fly above mountains volcanoes impact craters we fly over valleys  we can fly over surface magnetism <unk> the polar caps subsurface water <unk> and we can search for life on mars <unk> equal importance  as we fly through the atmosphere of mars <unk> we transmit that journey the first flight of an airplane outside of the earth <unk> we transmit those images back to earth  and our goal is to inspire the american public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars <unk> but more important we will inspire the next generation of scientists technologists <unk> engineers and mathematicians and that 's a critical area of national security and economic vitality to make sure we produce the next generation of scientists <unk> engineers mathematicians and technologists <unk>  this is what ares looks like as it flies over mars we preprogram it we will fly where the methane is we will have instruments aboard the plane <unk> that will sample every three minutes the atmosphere of mars <unk> we will look for methane as well as other gasses produced by living systems <unk> we will pinpoint <unk> where these gases emanate from because we can measure the gradient where it comes from  in two words very carefully <unk>  the problem is we don 't fly it to mars <unk> we put it in a spacecraft and we send it to mars <unk> the problem is the spacecraft 's largest diameter is nine feet we fold it <unk>  and we transport it in a spacecraft  and we have it in something called an aeroshell <unk> this is how we do it <unk> and we have a little video that describes the sequence <unk> taking nine months to get to mars <unk>  <unk> airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time <unk> we believe that in a one hour flight we can rewrite the textbook on mars by making high resolution measurements of the atmosphere looking for gases of biogenic origin <unk> looking for gases of volcanic origin <unk> studying the surface <unk> studying the magnetism on the surface which we don 't understand as well as about a dozen other <unk> areas practice makes perfect how do we know we can do it  because we have tested <unk> ares model <unk> several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the nasa langley research center for eight years under mars conditions  and of equal importance is we test <unk> in the earth 's atmosphere  at one hundred thousand feet <unk> which is comparable to the density and pressure of the atmosphere on mars where we 'll fly now one hundred thousand feet if you fly cross country to los angeles you fly thirty seven thousand feet  we do our tests at one hundred thousand feet and i want to show you one of our tests <unk> this is a half scale model this is a put the folded airplane on the balloon it took about three hours to to get up there and then we released it on command at one hundred and three thousand feet <unk>  and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly and we 've done <unk> model here but we have a full scale model in storage at the nasa langley research center <unk> we 're ready to go all we need is a check from nasa headquarters  to cover the costs i 'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today 's talk for this mission  there 's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing <unk> this is the ares team we have about one hundred and fifty scientists engineers where we 're working with jet propulsion laboratory goddard space flight center ames research center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this <unk> the first flight of an airplane outside of the earth
