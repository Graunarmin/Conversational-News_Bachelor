 <unk> a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant <unk> world class neuropsychologist <unk> i had a baby <unk> and that 's not to say i ever went on to become a brilliant <unk> did go on to be a reasonably astute <unk> arguably world class worrier <unk>  one of my girlfriends in graduate school marie said kim i figured it out <unk>  it 's not that you 're more neurotic than everyone else it 's just that you 're more honest about how neurotic you are so in the spirit of full <unk> of water and then finally all suited up for the <unk> 90 minute drive to copper mountain so you can get kind of a feel for this  so my baby vander is eight years old now <unk> and  despite being cursed with my athletic inability he plays soccer  he 's interested in playing football he wants to learn how to ride a unicycle so why would i worry  because this is what i do this is what i teach it 's what i study it 's what i treat and i know <unk> know that kids get concussed every year  in fact more than four million people sustain a concussion every year and these data are just among kids under fourteen who were seen in emergency rooms  and so when kids sustain a concussion we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung but what is it that we 're really talking about <unk> a car accident forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier thirty five gs  a heavyweight boxer punches you straight in the face <unk> one hundred and three gs <unk> the average concussive impact is ninety five gs <unk>  now when the kid on the right doesn 't get up we know they 've had a concussion but how about the kid on the left or the athlete that leaves the field of play how do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion how do we know that legislation that would require they be pulled from play <unk> cleared for return to <unk> play applies to them  the definition of concussion doesn 't actually require a loss of consciousness <unk>  it requires only a change in consciousness and that can be any one or a number of symptoms including feeling foggy feeling dizzy hearing a ringing in your ear <unk> being more impulsive or hostile than usual  so given all of that and given how darn neurotic i am <unk> how do i get any <unk> sleep at all because i know our brains are resilient  they 're designed to recover from an injury <unk> if god forbid any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion <unk> most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks  but kids are more vulnerable to brain injury in fact <unk> three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their <unk> <unk> college age peers and it takes them longer to return to a symptom free baseline <unk>  after that first injury their risk for second injury is exponentially greater from there <unk> their risk for a third <unk> and so on  and here 's the really alarming part we don 't fully understand the <unk> long term impact of multiple injuries  you guys may be familiar with this research that 's coming out of the nfl  in a nutshell this research suggests that among retired nfl players with three or more career concussions <unk> dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population <unk>  so you 've all seen that new york times you 've seen it what you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by nfl wives who said  isn 't it weird that my 46 year old husband is forever losing his keys <unk> losing his way home in the car from the driveway  i may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child  so it 's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around someday so how do we guarantee the safety of our kids how can <unk> we one hundred percent guarantee the safety of our kids let me tell you what i 've come up with  if only  my little boy 's right there and he 's like she 's not kidding <unk> she 's totally not kidding  so <unk> should my kid play football <unk> should your kid play football i don 't know but i do know there are three things you can do  the first study up  you have to be familiar with the issues we 're talking about today  there are some great resources out there the cdc has a program heads up it 's at cdc gov heads up is specific to concussion in kids  the second is a resource i 'm personally really proud of <unk> just rolled this out in the last couple months co kids with brain injury <unk>  this is a great resource for student athletes <unk> teachers parents professionals  athletic and coaching staff <unk> it 's a great place to start if you have questions  the second thing is speak up  just two weeks ago a bill introduced by senator kefalas that would have required athletes under eighteen to wear a helmet when they 're riding their bike died in committee <unk>  it died in large part because it lacked constituent buy in it lacked stakeholder traction  now i 'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn 't support but i am going to tell you that if it matters to you your legislators need to know that  <unk> up also with coaching staff <unk> ask about what kind of protective equipment is available what 's the budget for protective equipment how old it is  maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear <unk> which brings us to suit up wear a helmet  the only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening <unk> one of my graduate students tom said kim i 've decided to wear a bike helmet on the way to class and tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the g force of impact by half  now <unk> i thought it was because i have this totally compelling <unk> this epiphany of tom 's  as it turns out it occurred to tom that a $ twenty helmet is a good way to protect a $ one hundred thousand graduate education  laughter so <unk>  should vander play football <unk> i can 't say no but i can guarantee that every time he leaves the <unk> wearing a helmet like to the car or at school <unk>  so whether athlete scholar <unk> overprotected kid neurotic mom <unk> or otherwise here 's my baby vander reminding you to mind your matter
