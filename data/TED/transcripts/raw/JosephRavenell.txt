 <unk> what do you see  most of you see a barbershop  but i see an opportunity an opportunity for health  an opportunity for health equity <unk> for black men <unk> the barbershop is not just a place where you get your hair cut or your beard trimmed no it 's much more than that  historically <unk> the barbershop has been a safe haven for black men <unk>  it 's a place where we go for friendship <unk> solidarity and <unk> it 's a place where we go to get away from the stress of the grind of work and sometimes home life <unk> it 's a place where we don 't have to worry about how we 're being perceived by the outside world  it 's a place where we don 't feel threatened or threatening  it 's a place of loyalty and trust for that reason <unk> 's one of the few places where we can fearlessly be ourselves and just talk <unk>  the talk <unk> the shop talk the conversation that is the essence of the black barbershop <unk>  i can remember going to the barbershop with my dad as a kid  we went to mr mike 's barbershop every other saturday <unk> and like clockwork <unk> the same group of men would be there every time we went either waiting on their favorite barber or just soaking up the atmosphere <unk> i can remember the jovial greeting that warmly welcomed us every time we went  hey rev they would say to my dad he 's a local pastor <unk> and they treated him like a celebrity <unk> hey young fella how you doing they would say to me <unk> making me feel just as special <unk>  i remember the range of the conversations was immense <unk>  the men would talk about politics and sports and music and world news <unk> national news <unk> <unk> there was some talk about women and what it was like to be a black man in america <unk> but many times they also talked about health  the conversations about health were lengthy and deep <unk>  the men often recounted their doctor 's recommendations to cut salt in their diet or to eat less fried foods or to stop smoking or to <unk> reduce stress they talked about the different ways you could reduce stress like simplifying one 's love life  all ways to treat high blood pressure <unk> there 's a lot of talk about high blood pressure in the <unk> that 's because almost forty percent of black men have it that means that almost every single black man either has high blood pressure or knows a black man who has it <unk>  sometimes those conversations in the barbershop would be about what happens when high blood pressure is not adequately <unk> you hear about eddie <unk> he died last week <unk> massive heart attack <unk> he was fifty  more black men die from high blood pressure than from anything else <unk>  even though decades of medical wisdom and science have demonstrated that death from high blood pressure can be prevented with <unk> timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment <unk> so why is high blood pressure so differentially deadly for black men <unk>  because too often high blood pressure is either untreated or under treated in black men  in part because of our lower engagement with the primary healthcare system <unk> in particular those with high blood pressure <unk> are less likely to have a primary care doctor than other groups but why  some of our earliest research on black men 's health revealed that for many the doctor 's office is associated with fear <unk>  mistrust <unk> disrespect <unk> and unnecessary <unk> the doctor 's office is only a place that you go when you don 't feel well and when you do go you might wait for hours only to get the run around and to be evaluated by a stoic figure in a white coat who only has ten minutes to give you and who doesn 't value the talk <unk> so it 's no wonder that some men don 't want to be bothered and skip going to the <unk> doctor altogether <unk> especially if they feel fine  but herein lies the problem you can feel just fine while high blood pressure ravages your most vital organs <unk>  this is denny moe <unk> owner <unk> of denny moe 's superstar barbershop in harlem <unk> i 've been lucky enough to have denny as my barber for the last eight years <unk>  he said to me once hey doc you know <unk> lots of black men trust their barbers more than they trust their doctors  this was stunning to me at first <unk> but not so much when you think about it  black men have been with their current barbers on average as long as i 've been with denny about eight years <unk>  and black men see their barbers about every two weeks  not only do you trust your barber with your look and with your style <unk>  but you also trust him with your secrets and sometimes your life <unk>  denny like many barbers is more than just an <unk> a businessman and confidant <unk> he 's a leader and a passionate advocate for the well being of his community <unk>  the very first time i walked into denny moe 's shop he wasn 't just cutting hair <unk>  he was also orchestrating a voter registration drive to give a voice to his customers and his community  with this kind of activism and community <unk> investment that typifies the black barbershop of course the barbershop is a perfect place to talk about high blood pressure and other health concerns in the community  first the barbershop is not a medical setting  and so it doesn 't have all the negative psychological baggage that comes along with that  when you 're in a barbershop and you 're among friends who share your history your struggle and your health risks <unk> second because the barbershop is a place of connection <unk> loyalty and trust  it 's a place where you 're more open to have a conversation about health and especially about high blood <unk> after all conversations about high blood pressure have all the elements of great shop talk  stress and high blood pressure <unk> food and high blood pressure <unk>  relationships and high blood pressure and yes what it 's like to be a black man in america and high blood pressure <unk>  but you can do more than just talk about high blood pressure in the barbershop you can concretely take action here we have an opportunity to partner with the denny moe 's of the world and empower communities to address the health inequities that uniquely affect it  when high blood pressure screening expanded from clinics and hospitals to communities in the 1960s and ' 70s black physicians like <unk> eli saunders in baltimore and dr keith ferdinand in new orleans were at the forefront of bringing health promotion to community hubs in urban black neighborhoods <unk>  these pioneers paved the way for my professional journey with barbershops and health which began in chicago in medical school <unk>  the very first research project that i worked on as a medical student was to help design healthcare interventions that would appeal to black <unk> men <unk> we conducted about a dozen focus groups with a broad <unk> cross section of black men <unk>  and we learned that for them being healthy was as much about being perceived as healthy as it was about feeling healthy  and that feeling good went hand in hand with looking good  this work led to the development of <unk> project brotherhood a community clinic founded by dr eric whitaker that provided tailored healthcare to black men <unk>  part of this tailored care involved having a barber on the premises to reward the men who came for needed healthcare with a free haircut  to let the men <unk> valued how they looked as well as how they felt <unk> and that what was important to them was also important to us <unk>  but while there 's only one project brotherhood <unk>  there are thousands of black barbershops where the intersection of health and haircuts can be cultivated <unk>  the next stop on my journey was dallas <unk> where we learned that barbers were not only willing but fully able to roll up their sleeves and participate in delivering needed health services to improve the health of their customers and their community  we teamed up with an amazing cadre of black barbers and taught them how to measure blood pressure and how to counsel their customers and refer them to doctors to help manage high blood pressure <unk>  the barbers were not only willing to do it but they were damn good at it  over a three year period <unk> the barbers measured thousands of blood pressures resulting in hundreds of black men being referred to doctors for medical care of their high blood pressure <unk>  <unk> partnerships resulted in a <unk> twenty percent increase in the number of men who were able to achieve target blood pressure levels and a three point drop on average in the blood pressure of each participant  if we were to extrapolate that three point drop to every single black man with high blood pressure in america we would prevent eight hundred heart attacks <unk>  five hundred strokes and nine hundred deaths from high blood pressure in just one year <unk> our experience with barbershops has been no different in new york city where my journey has currently led me  with an incredible team of diverse research assistants community health workers and volunteers  we 've been able to partner with over two hundred barbershops and other trusted community venues to reach over seven thousand older black men <unk> and we 've offered high blood pressure <unk> screening and counseling to each and every one of them  thanks to denny moe and the myriad other barbers and community leaders who shared the vision of opportunity and empowerment to make a difference in their communities we 've been able to not only lower blood pressure in our participants <unk> but we 've also been able to impact other health indicators so what do you see  what is your barbershop  where is that place for you where people who are affected by a unique problem can meet a unique solution  when you find that place see the opportunity <unk> thank you
