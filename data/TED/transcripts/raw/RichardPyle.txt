 <unk> this is the first of two rather extraordinary photographs i 'm going to show you today it was taken eighteen years ago <unk> i was nineteen years old at the time i had just returned from one of the deepest dives i 'd ever made at that time a little over two hundred feet <unk>  and i had caught this little fish it turns out that that particular one was the first <unk> taken alive i 'm not just an ichthyologist i 'm a bona fide fish nerd and to a fish nerd this is some pretty exciting stuff more exciting was the fact that the person who took this photo is a guy named jack randall the greatest living ichthyologist on earth the grand poobah of fish nerds if you will and so it was really exciting to me to have this moment in time it set the course for the rest of my life but really the most significant <unk> thing about this picture is it was taken two days before i was completely paralyzed from the neck down i made a really stupid kind of mistake that most 19 year old males do when they think they 're immortal and i got a bad case of the bends and was paralyzed and had to be flown back for treatment i learned two really important things that day the first thing i learned <unk> i 'm mortal that 's a really big one <unk> and the second thing i learned was that i knew with profound certainty that this is exactly what i was going to do for the rest of my life i had to focus all my energies towards going to find new species of things down on deep coral reefs when you think of a coral reef this is what most people think of these big hard elaborate corals lots of bright colorful fishes and things but this is really just the tip of the iceberg if you look at this diagram of a coral reef we know a lot about that part up near the top <unk> reason we know so much about it is scuba divers can very easily go down there and access it <unk> there is a problem with scuba though in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go it turns out that that depth is about two hundred feet  i 'll get into why that is in just a minute but the point is scuba divers generally stay less than one hundred feet deep and very rarely go much below this at least <unk> not with any kind of sanity so to go deeper <unk>  most biologists have turned to submersibles now submersibles are great wonderful things but if you 're going to spend thirty thousand dollars a day to use one of these things and it 's capable of going two thousand feet you 're not <unk> <unk> going to go farting around up here in a couple of hundred feet you 're going to go way way down deep so the bottom line is almost all research using submersibles has taken place well below five hundred feet now it 's pretty obvious at this point there 's a zone here <unk> centers around my own personal pursuit of happiness <unk> i want to find out what 's in this zone we know almost nothing about it scuba divers can 't get there submarines go right on past it it took me a year to learn to walk again after my diving accident in palau during that year i spent a lot of time learning about the physics and physiology of diving and how to overcome these limitations i 'm just going <unk> <unk> to show you a basic idea we 're all breathing air right now air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen <unk> twenty percent oxygen eighty percent nitrogen it 's in our lungs and there 's a phenomenon called henry 's law that says gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures <unk> you 're exposing them to so basically the gas dissolves into our body the oxygen is bound by <unk> <unk> metabolism we use it for energy the nitrogen sort of floats around in our blood and tissues that 's fine it 's how we 're designed <unk>  <unk> the higher the pressure is if you were to go down to a depth of about one hundred and thirty feet which is the recommended limit for most scuba divers  you 'd get this pressure effect <unk> the effect of that pressure is you have an increased density of gas molecules in every breath you take over time <unk> those gas molecules dissolve into your blood and tissues and start to fill you up  now if you were to go down to say three hundred feet you don 't have five times as many gas molecules in your lungs <unk> you 've got ten times as many gas molecules in your lungs and sure enough <unk> they dissolve into your blood and tissues as <unk> well and if you were to go down to where there 's fifteen times as much the deeper you go the more exacerbating the problem becomes <unk> the limitation of diving with air is all those dots in your body all the nitrogen and all the oxygen there are three basic limitations of of scuba diving  the first limitation is the oxygen oxygen toxicity now we all know the song love is like oxygen you get too much you get too high not enough and you 're gonna die well in the context of diving <unk> get too much you die also you die because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure it makes you convulse underwater not a good thing to happen underwater it happens because there 's too much concentration of oxygen in your body <unk> the nitrogen has two problems one of them is what jacques cousteau called rapture of the deep <unk> it 's nitrogen narcosis it <unk> you loopy the deeper you go the loopier you get you don 't want to drive drunk you don 't want to dive drunk so that 's a real big problem and of course the third problem is the one i found out the hard way in palau which is the bends one thing i forgot to mention is that to obviate the problem of nitrogen narcosis all of those blue dots in our body you remove the nitrogen and replace it with helium helium 's a gas there 're a lot of reasons why helium 's good it 's a tiny molecule it 's inert it doesn 't give you <unk> so that 's the basic concept we use but the theory 's relatively easy  the tricky part is the implementation so this is how i began about fifteen years ago <unk> i 'll admit it wasn 't exactly the smartest of starts but you 've got to start somewhere laughter at the time i wasn 't the only one who didn 't know what i was doing almost nobody did this rig was actually used for a dive of three hundred feet <unk> but over time we got better at it and we came up with this really sophisticated looking rig with four scuba tanks five regulators and all the right gas mixtures all that good stuff it was fine and dandy allowed us to go down and find new species this picture was taken at three hundred feet catching new species of fish <unk> the problem was it didn 't allow us much time for all its bulk and size it only gave us about fifteen minutes at most down at those sorts of depths we needed more time there had to be a better way <unk>  and indeed there is a better way in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four i was fortunate enough to get access to these prototype <unk> scuba and why is it better  well <unk>  there are three main advantages to a rebreather one they 're quiet they don 't make any noise two they allow you to stay underwater longer three they allow you to go deeper how is it that they do that in order to really understand how they do that you have to look underneath the hood and see what 's going on there are three basic systems to a closed circuit rebreather <unk> the most fundamental is called the breathing loop it 's a breathing loop because you breathe off of it <unk> 's a closed loop and you breathe the same gas around and around and around there 's a mouthpiece that you put in your mouth <unk>  and there <unk> 's a counter lung or in this case two counter lungs the counter lungs aren 't high tech they 're simply flexible bags <unk> they allow you to mechanically breathe mechanically ventilate when you exhale it goes in the exhale counter lung <unk>  when you inhale it comes from the inhale counter lung it 's just pure <unk> allowing you to cycle air through this breathing loop the other component on a breathing loop is the <unk> <unk> carbon dioxide absorbent canister now <unk> as we breathe we produce carbon dioxide and that carbon dioxide needs to be scrubbed out of the system there 's a chemical filter in there that pulls the carbon dioxide out of the breathing gas so that when it comes back to us it 's safe to breathe again <unk> that 's the breathing loop in a nutshell the second main component of a closed circuit rebreather is the gas system the primary purpose of the gas <unk> system is to provide oxygen to replenish the oxygen that your body consumes <unk> so the main tank the main critical thing is this oxygen gas supply cylinder we have here <unk> but if we <unk> <unk> only had an oxygen gas supply cylinder we wouldn 't be able to go very deep because we 'd run into oxygen toxicity very very quickly <unk> so we need another gas something to dilute the oxygen with and that fittingly enough is called the diluent gas supply <unk> air inside this diluent gas supply because it 's a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen <unk> so that 's where we get our nitrogen from but if we want to go deeper of course we need another gas supply <unk>  and helium is what we really need to go deep usually we 'll have a slightly larger cylinder mounted exterior on the rebreather like this that 's what we use to inject as we start to do our deep dives we also have a second oxygen cylinder solely as a backup if there 's a problem with our first oxygen supply we can continue to breathe <unk> the way you manage all these different gases and different gas supplies is this really high tech sophisticated gas block up on the front here where it 's easy to reach it 's got the valves and knobs and things you need to inject the right gases at the right time <unk>  normally you don 't have to do that because all of it 's done automatically with the electronics the third system of a rebreather the most critical part of a rebreather are the oxygen sensors you need three so if one goes bad <unk> know which one it is you need voting logic you also have three microprocessors any one of those computers can run the entire system so if you have to lose two of them there 's back up power supplies and there <unk> are multiple displays to get the information to the diver this is the the high tech gadgetry that allows us to do what we do on these deep dives i can talk about it all day just ask my wife <unk> but i want to move on to something much more interesting i 'm going to take you on a deep dive and show you what it 's like to do one we start up on the boat for all this high tech expensive equipment this is still the best way to get in the water just flop over the side of the boat <unk>  now as i showed you in the earlier diagram these reefs that we we dive on start out near the surface and they go almost vertically completely straight down so we drop in the water and go over the edge of this cliff <unk> a long time to get there no it only takes a couple minutes to get down to three or four hundred feet which is what we 're aiming for it 's like skydiving in slow motion it 's really very interesting you ever see the abyss where ed harris is sinking down along the side of the wall that 's what it feels like amazing and down there you find that the water is very very clear extremely clear because there 's hardly any plankton when you turn on your light and look around <unk> you 're confronted with a tremendous amount of diversity much more than anyone used to believe <unk> now <unk> not all of it is new species that fish you see with the white stripe <unk> that 's a known species but if you look carefully into the cracks and crevices you 'll see little things scurrying all over the place <unk> there 's a just unbelievable diversity it 's not just fish either these are crinoids sponges black corals there 're some <unk> those fishes that you see now are new species they 're still new species <unk> because i had a video camera instead of my net so they 're still waiting down there for someone to go find them <unk> but this is what it looks like and this <unk> <unk> kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles this is papua new guinea <unk>  <unk> your back you 're in a remote reef off papua new guinea thousands of miles from the nearest recompression chamber <unk> and you 're completely surrounded by sharks <unk> we 're down there this is at four hundred feet that 's looking straight up by the way to give a sense of how far the surface is <unk>  and if you 're a biologist and know about sharks and you want to assess how much jeopardy am i really in here <unk> there 's one one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately <unk>  which is <unk> here <unk> the silvertips are the ones with the white edges on the fins and there 're also gray reef sharks and hammerheads off in the distance and yes it 's a little <unk> impression about sharks they 're actually not very dangerous animals that 's why we weren 't worried much and were joking around more people are killed by pigs by lightning strikes more people are killed at soccer <unk> <unk> games in england there 's a lot of other ways you can die and i 'm not making that stuff up coconuts you can get killed by a coconut more likely than killed by a shark  <unk> and world report i got the recent issue there 's a cover story about the great explorers of our time <unk> the last article is <unk> <unk> no new frontiers it questions whether or not there really are any new frontiers out there but it 's much more than that <unk> i want to show you a few of the guppies we 've we 've found over the years <unk> this one you can see how ugly it is  even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing look at the monetary value of this thing a couple of these were sold through the aquarium trade to japan where they sold for fifteen thousand dollars apiece that 's half a million dollars a pound  here 's another new <unk> angelfish we discovered <unk>  this one we first discovered back in the air days the bad old air days when we were doing these kind of dives with air we were at three hundred and sixty feet <unk> i remember coming up from one of these deep dives and i had this fog and <unk> the narcosis takes a little while to to fade away sort of like sobering up i had this vague recollection of seeing this yellow fish with a black spot and thought  <unk> enough i had caught one i just completely forgot <unk> so this one we decided to give the name centropyge narcosis to that 's its official scientific name in reference to its deep dwelling habits this is another neat one <unk>  when we first found it we weren 't even sure what family it belonged to so we just called it the dr seuss fish since it looked like something from one of those books <unk>  <unk> this one 's pretty cool  if you go to papua new guinea and go down three hundred feet you 'll see these big mounds this may be hard to see but they 're a couple meters in diameter if you look closely you 'll see there 's a little white and gray fish that hangs out near them  it turns out this little white fish builds these giant mounds one pebble at a time it 's extraordinary to find something like this it 's not just new species it 's new behaviors new ecology all kind of new things what i 'm going to show you now <unk> of the new species we 've discovered what 's extraordinary is not just the number of species we 're finding though as you can see that 's pretty amazing this is only half of what we 've found what 's extraordinary is how quickly we find them we 're up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth <unk> if you go to an amazon jungle and fog a tree you may get a lot of bugs but for fishes there 's nowhere in the world you can get seven new <unk> five hundred new species in the indo pacific alone there are only five to six thousand known species so a very large percentage of what is out there isn 't really known we thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity evidently not i 'm going to just close on a very somber note at the beginning i said i 'd show you two extraordinary photographs this is the second extraordinary photograph i 'm going to show you <unk> the exact moment i was down there filming those sharks this was taken exactly three hundred feet above my head <unk> the reason this photograph is extraordinary is because it captures a moment in the very last minute of a person 's life <unk> less than sixty seconds after this picture was taken this guy was dead <unk>  when we recovered his body <unk> we figured out what had gone wrong he had made a very simple mistake he turned the wrong valve when he filled his cylinder he had eighty percent oxygen in his tank when he should <unk> have had forty he had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned <unk> the reason i show this not to put a downer on everything but i just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general which is that we all have two goals <unk> the first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet which is to survive <unk> i call it perpetuation the survival of the species and <unk> and those are both about perpetuating the genome the second goal for those of us who have mastered the first goal call it spiritual fulfillment call it financial success you can call it any number of different things <unk> i call it seeking joy <unk> this pursuit of happiness <unk> so i <unk> <unk> guess my theme on this is this guy lived his life to the fullest he absolutely did you have to balance those two goals if you live your whole life in fear i mean life is a sexually transmitted disease with one hundred percent mortality <unk> so you can 't live your life in fear  i thought that was an old one  but at the same time <unk> you don 't want to get so focused on rule number two goal number two that you neglect goal number one <unk> because once you 're dead you really can <unk> <unk> 't enjoy anything after that so i wish you all the best of luck in maintaining that balance in your future endeavors
