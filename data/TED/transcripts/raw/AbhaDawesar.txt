 <unk> i was in new york during hurricane sandy <unk> and this little white dog called maui was staying with me <unk>  half the city was dark because of a power cut <unk> and i was living on the dark side  now maui was terrified of the dark so i had to carry him up the stairs actually down the stairs first <unk> for his walk <unk> and then bring him back up i was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day <unk>  and through all of this i had to hold a torch between my teeth <unk> the stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread for a shower <unk> i walked forty blocks to a branch of my gym <unk> but these were not the major preoccupations of my day <unk> it was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices <unk> i started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points <unk>  i wasn 't the only one <unk> even in the rain people stood between madison and 5th avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street <unk> had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology <unk> and yet here we were obsessed about being wired  i think there 's nothing like a crisis to tell you what 's really important and what 's not  and sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food <unk> and shelter  the self as we once knew it no longer exists <unk>  and i think that an abstract digital universe has become a part of our identity  and i want to talk to you about what i think that means  i 'm a novelist and i 'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common they 're both stories <unk> interpretations  you and i can experience things without a story we might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless but the larger sense that we have of our lives the slightly more abstract one is indirect  our story of our life is based on direct experience <unk> but it 's embellished  a novel needs scene after scene to build and the story of our life needs an arc as well  it needs months and years <unk> discrete moments from our lives are its chapters <unk> but the story is not about these <unk> chapters it 's the whole book <unk>  it 's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness the victories and the disappointments <unk>  but it 's because how because of these and sometimes more importantly in spite of these we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves  our story therefore needs two dimensions of time a long arc of time that is our lifespan <unk> and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment  now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment <unk> but the one that narrates needs several moments a whole sequence of them <unk>  and that 's why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time <unk> <unk> the flow of time is embedded in everything in the erosion of a grain of sand in the budding of a little bud into a rose without it <unk> we would have no music our own emotions and state of mind often encode time <unk>  regret or nostalgia about the past <unk> hope or dread about the future <unk>  i think that technology has altered <unk> the overall time that we have for our narrative our lifespan has been increasing but the smallest measure the moment has shrunk <unk>  it has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time <unk>  and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world  and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers <unk> of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen <unk>  science can do things with and in a picosecond but you and i are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second  you and i answer only to nature 's rhythm and flow to the <unk> the moon and the seasons <unk>  and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past the present and the future to see things for what they are to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations  we need time 's arrow to understand cause and effect not just in the material world but in our own intentions and our motivations  what happens when that arrow goes awry what happens when time warps so <unk> many of us today have the sensation that time 's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once  this is because time doesn 't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one <unk> we all know that the internet has shrunk space as well as time <unk> far away over there is now here <unk> news from india is a stream on my smartphone app whether i 'm in new york or new delhi your last job your dinner reservations from last year your former friends lie on a flat plain with today 's friends because the internet also archives and it warps the past  with no distinction left between the past <unk> the present and the future and the here or there we are left with this moment everywhere  this moment that i 'll call the digital now just how can we prioritize in the <unk> landscape of the digital now  this digital now is not the present because it 's always a few seconds ahead with twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones  this isn 't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book <unk>  this now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state its focus instead is to distract us at every turn on the road  every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else are you reading an interview by an author why not buy his book <unk> tweet <unk> <unk> it <unk> share it <unk> like it <unk> find other books exactly like his <unk> find other people reading those books  <unk> choice is freedom but not when it 's constantly for its own sake not just is the digital now far from the present but it 's in direct competition with it  and this is because not just am i absent from it <unk> but so are you not just are we absent from it but so is everyone else and therein lies its greatest convenience and horror <unk> i i can order foreign language books in the middle of the night shop for parisian macarons and leave video messages that get picked up later at all times i can operate at a different rhythm and <unk> <unk> pace from you while i sustain the illusion that i 'm tapped into you in real time <unk>  for some reason technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does <unk>  and then like an ironic slap in the face it makes it true  for example it 's said that there are more people in india with access to cell phones than toilets  now if this rift which is already so great in many parts of the world between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology isn 't somehow bridged <unk> will be ruptures between the digital and the real for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it  the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous  how does one live inside distraction  we might think that those younger than us those who are born into this will adapt more naturally <unk> possibly <unk> but i remember my childhood i remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me  buda and pest were separated by the danube and vienna had a spanish riding school  if i were a child today i could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks <unk> but it really wouldn 't be the same because <unk> i went to vienna <unk> and i went to the spanish riding school <unk> and i could feel my grandfather right beside me  night after night he took me up on the terrace on his shoulders <unk> and pointed out jupiter and saturn and the great bear to me  and even here when i look at the great bear i get back that feeling of being a child  hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder <unk>  and i can get back that feeling of being a child again what i had <unk> with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact <unk>  but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact time warping technology challenges our deepest core because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes <unk> as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable <unk>  we want to clutch and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments they 're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them <unk> by archiving everything <unk> we think that we can store it <unk> but time is not data it cannot be stored  <unk> it might have happened while we were playing an instrument or looking into the eyes of someone we 've known for a very long time <unk>  at such moments our selves are complete the self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one <unk>  the present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future <unk>  the present joins a flow of time from before and after i first experienced these feelings with my grandmother <unk> i wanted to learn to skip and she found <unk> an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it <unk> i wanted to learn to cook and she kept me in the kitchen cutting cubing and chopping for a whole month  my grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take that time can 't be fought <unk>  and because it will pass and it will move we owe the present moment our full attention attention is time  one of my yoga <unk> instructors once said that love is attention and definitely from my grandmother love and attention were one and the same thing  the digital world cannibalizes time <unk> and in doing so i want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves <unk> it threatens the flow of love but we don 't need to let it <unk> we can choose <unk> otherwise <unk> we 've seen again and again just how creative technology can be and in our lives and in our actions we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it <unk> we can slow down and we can <unk> the ebb and flow of time <unk> we can choose to take time back thank you
