 <unk> lives a secret life all around us we utter about six metaphors a minute <unk> metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others <unk> but metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words  now to assist me in explaining this i 've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers <unk>  the reigning king of the metaphorians a man whose contributions to the field are so great that he himself has become a metaphor i am of course <unk> referring to none other than elvis presley  now all shook up is a great love song it 's also a great example of how whenever we deal with anything abstract ideas emotions feelings concepts thoughts we inevitably resort to metaphor in all shook up a touch is not a <unk> but a chill  lips are not lips but volcanoes she is not she <unk> but a buttercup  and love is not love but being all shook up  in this elvis is following aristotle 's classic definition of metaphor as the process of giving the thing a name that belongs to something else <unk>  this is the mathematics of metaphor and fortunately it 's very simple x equals laughter this formula works wherever metaphor is present <unk> elvis uses it <unk> but so does shakespeare in this famous line from romeo and juliet juliet is the sun now <unk> here shakespeare gives the thing juliet a name that belongs to <unk> whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else we give it a whole network of analogies too  we mix and match what we know about the metaphor 's source in this case the sun with what we know about its target <unk> juliet <unk>  and metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of juliet than if shakespeare had literally described what she looks like  so how do we make and understand metaphors this might look familiar <unk> the first step is <unk> pattern recognition look at this image what do you see  three wayward pac men and three pointy brackets are actually present what we see however are two overlapping triangles  metaphor is not just the detection of patterns it is the creation of patterns <unk> second step conceptual <unk> synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ in another sense organ as well <unk> such as colored hearing  people with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters  we all have synesthetic abilities this is the bouba kiki test what you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called <unk> percent of other people you will identify the round amoeboid shape as bouba <unk> and the sharp spiky one as kiki  can we do a quick show of hands does that correspond okay i think ninety nine point nine would about cover it  why do we do that because we instinctively <unk> or create a pattern between the round shape and the round sound of bouba <unk> and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of kiki <unk>  and many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic silence is sweet  neckties are loud <unk> sexually attractive people are hot <unk> sexually unattractive people leave <unk> metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia in which we understand one concept in the context of another  third step is cognitive dissonance this is the stroop test what you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed you can take the test now <unk>  if you 're like most <unk> you will experience a moment of cognitive dissonance when the name of the color is printed in a differently colored ink  the test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well the participants had to identify as quickly as possible the literally false sentences  they took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences <unk> we cannot ignore the metaphorical meaning of words either one of the sentences was some jobs are jails  now <unk> unless you 're a prison guard <unk> the sentence some jobs are jails is literally false <unk> sadly it 's metaphorically true <unk>  and the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability to identify it as literally false  metaphor matters because it 's around us every day <unk> the time  metaphor matters because it creates expectations pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news  agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing as in the nasdaq climbed higher  object metaphors describe price movements as non living <unk> the dow fell like a brick researchers asked a group of people to read a clutch of market commentaries and then predict the next day 's price trend  those exposed to agent metaphors had higher expectations that price trends would continue <unk>  and they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal  if for example <unk> house prices are routinely described as climbing and climbing higher and higher people might naturally assume that that rise is unstoppable they may feel confident <unk> say in taking out mortgages they really can 't afford that 's a hypothetical example of course <unk> but this is how metaphor misleads  metaphor also matters because it influences decisions by activating analogies <unk> a group of students was told that a small democratic country had been invaded and had asked the u s for help <unk>  and they had to make a decision what should they do intervene appeal to the u n or do nothing  they were each then given one of three descriptions of this hypothetical crisis each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy  world war ii vietnam <unk> and the third was historically neutral  those exposed to the world war ii scenario made more <unk> interventionist recommendations than the others  just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor  metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery whenever we solve a problem <unk> or make a discovery  we compare what we know with what we don 't know  and the only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the ways it might be like <unk> like the former einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play he famously used thought experiments which are essentially elaborate analogies to come up with some of his greatest discoveries  by bringing together what we know and what we don 't know through analogy metaphorical thinking strikes <unk> the spark that ignites discovery now metaphor is ubiquitous <unk> yet it 's hidden <unk> but you just have to look at the words around you and you 'll find it  ralph waldo emerson described language as fossil poetry but before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor  and these fossils still breathe <unk>  take the three most famous words in all of western philosophy <unk> cogito ergo sum that 's routinely translated as i think <unk> therefore i am  but there is a better translation the latin word cogito is derived from the prefix <unk> shake things up <unk> therefore i am
