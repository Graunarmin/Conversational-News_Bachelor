 <unk> as a brain scientist i 'm actually interested in how the brain learns <unk>  and i 'm especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter better <unk> and faster  this is in this context i 'm going to tell you about video games <unk> when we say video games most of you think about children it 's true <unk> ninety percent of children do play video games <unk>  but let 's be frank <unk> when the kids are in bed who is in front of the playstation  most of you <unk> the average age of a gamer is thirty three years old not eight years old <unk> and in fact if we look at the projected demographics of video game play the video game players of tomorrow are older adults  so video [ gaming ] is pervasive throughout our society <unk>  it is clearly here to stay <unk>  it has an amazing impact on our everyday life consider these statistics released by activision <unk> after one month of release of the game call of duty black ops it had been played for <unk> thousand years worldwide <unk> right <unk> would any of you complain if this was the case about doing linear algebra <unk> so <unk> asking in the lab is how can we leverage that power <unk>  now i want to step back a bit <unk>  i know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games  the name of the game is to get after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you right <unk>  and i 'm almost sure most of you have <unk> you do something more intelligent than shooting at zombies  i 'd like you to put this kind of knee jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku or your boy reading shakespeare <unk> right <unk> most parents would find that great well i 'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health <unk> it 's not and binging is never good <unk>  but i 'm going to argue that in reasonable doses actually the very game i showed you at the beginning those action packed shooter games have quite powerful effects and positive effects on many different aspects of our behavior <unk>  there 's not one week that goes without some major headlines in <unk> media about whether video games are good or bad for you right <unk> you 're all bombarded with that  i 'd like to put this kind of friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab <unk>  what we do in the lab is actually measure directly in a quantitative fashion <unk> what is the impact of video games on the brain <unk>  and so i 'm going to take a <unk> few examples from our work one first saying that i 'm sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse <unk>  that 's a statement about vision <unk>  there may be vision scientists among you we actually know how to test that statement we can step into the lab and measure how good your vision <unk> guess what  people that don 't play a lot of action games that don 't actually spend a lot of time in front of screens have normal or what we call <unk> corrective to normal vision <unk> that 's okay <unk>  the issue is what happens with these guys that actually indulge into playing video games like five hours per week ten hours per week fifteen hours per week by that statement their vision should be really bad right <unk>  guess what their vision is really really good it 's better than those that <unk> in two different ways <unk>  the first way is that they 're actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter <unk> and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magnifier glasses <unk> you can actually do it with just your eyesight <unk>  the other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray <unk> imagine you 're driving in a fog <unk> that makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avoiding the accident or getting into an accident <unk>  so we 're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision <unk>  and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better  clearly when it comes to action video games screen time doesn 't make your eyesight worse <unk> another saying that i 'm sure you have all heard around video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability <unk>  okay <unk>  we know how to measure attention in the lab i 'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so i 'm going to ask you to participate so you 're going to have to actually play the game <unk> going to show you colored words <unk> i want you to shout out the color of the ink <unk> right so this is the first example because i introduced a conflict between the word itself and its color  how good your attention is determines actually how fast you resolve that conflict so the young guys here at the top of their game probably like did a little better than some of us that are older <unk> what we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games they actually resolve the conflict faster <unk> so clearly playing those action games doesn 't lead to attention problems  actually those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world  this is something we use all the time when you 're driving <unk> you 're tracking keeping track of the cars around you you 're also keeping track of the pedestrian <unk> the running dog and that 's how you can actually be safe driving right  in the lab <unk> we get people to come to the lab sit in front of a computer screen and we give them little tasks that i 'm going to get you to do again  you 're going to see yellow happy faces and a few sad blue faces these are children in the schoolyard in geneva during a recess during the winter  <unk> kids are happy <unk> it 's actually recess but a few kids are sad and blue because they 've forgotten their coat  everybody begins to move around and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who didn 't  so i 'm just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid it 's easy because you can actually track it with your eyes you can track you can track and then when it stops and there is a question mark and i ask you  did this kid have a coat <unk> or not was it yellow initially or blue <unk>  i hear a few yellow good so most of you have a brain i 'm now going to ask you to do the task but now with a little more challenging task there are going to be three of them that are blue  don 't move your eyes please don 't move your eyes <unk> keep your eyes fixated and expand pull your attention that 's the only way you can actually do it if you move your eyes you 're doomed yellow or blue audience  yellow db good so your typical normal young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention that 's what we just did  your action video game player has a span of about six to seven objects of attention which is what is shown in this video here <unk> that 's for you guys <unk> we actually see the effects of video games on people 's behavior <unk> we can use brain imaging and look at the impact of video games on the brain and we do find <unk> many changes but the main changes are actually to the brain networks that control attention so one part is the parietal cortex which is very well known to control the orientation of attention <unk>  the other one is the frontal lobe which controls how we sustain attention  and another one is the anterior cingulate which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict  now when we do brain imaging we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action <unk> games <unk>  this actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding in the literature about technology and the brain <unk>  you all know about multitasking <unk> you all have been faulty of multitasking when you 're driving and you pick up your cellphone  bad idea very bad idea <unk> why because as your attention shifts to your you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you and so you 're much more likely to get engaged into a car accident <unk>  now we can measure that kind of skills in the lab <unk> we obviously don 't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have that would be a little costly <unk> but we design tasks on the computer where we can measure to millisecond accuracy how good they are at switching from one task to another  when we do that we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really really good they switch really fast very swiftly they pay a very small cost now i 'd like you to remember that result <unk> and put it in the context of another group of technology users a group which is actually much revered by society <unk> which are people that engage in <unk> <unk> the fact that most of us most of our children are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they 're doing search on the web at the same time as they 're chatting on facebook with their friends <unk>  that 's a <unk> there was a first study done by colleagues at stanford and that we replicated that <unk> showed that those people that identify as being high <unk> are absolutely abysmal at multitasking when we measure them in the lab they 're really bad <unk>  right <unk> so these kinds of results really makes two main points <unk> the first one is that not all media are created equal <unk>  you can 't compare the effect of <unk> and the effect of playing action games they have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition perception and attention <unk>  even within video games i 'm telling you right now about these action packed video games <unk> different video games have a different effect on your brains  so we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game <unk>  the other lesson is that general wisdom carries no <unk> weight i showed that to you already like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time those action gamers have a lot of very good vision <unk> etc <unk> here <unk> what was really striking is that these undergraduates that actually report engaging in a lot of high <unk> are convinced they aced the test <unk> so you show them their data you show them they are bad and <unk> not possible you know they have this sort of gut feeling that really they are doing really really good <unk>  that 's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain  now in a sense when we think about the effect of video games on the brain it 's very similar to the effect of wine on the health there are some very poor uses <unk> of wine there are some very poor uses of video games <unk>  but when consumed in reasonable doses <unk> and at the right age  wine can be very good for health there are actually specific molecules that have been identified in red wine as leading to greater <unk> so it 's the same way like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity learning attention vision <unk> etc <unk> <unk> and so we need and we 're working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them <unk> patients we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform  i 'm much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forcing you to play an action game i can actually change your vision for the better  whether you want to play that action game or not right that 's the point of rehabilitation or education most of the kids don 't go to school <unk> saying great two hours of math so that 's really the crux of the research and to do that we need to go one more step and one more step is to do training studies <unk>  so let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation  mental rotation is a task where i 'm going to ask you and again you 're going to do <unk> the task  to look at this shape study it it 's a target shape <unk>  and i 'm going to present to you four different shapes one of these four different shapes is actually a rotated version of this shape <unk> i want you to tell me which one  the first one second one <unk> third one or fourth one okay  i 'll help you fourth one one more get those brains <unk> come on <unk> that 's our target shape <unk>  third good <unk> this is hard right like the reason that i asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing right it doesn 't really feel like playing mindless action video games <unk> well <unk> what we do in these training studies is people come to the lab they do tasks like this one <unk>  we then force them to <unk> play ten hours of action games <unk> they don 't play ten hours of action games in a row they do distributed practice so little shots of forty minutes several days over a period of two weeks then once they are done with the training they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task <unk>  so this is work from a colleague in toronto what they showed is that initially subjects perform where they are expected to perform given their age <unk>  after two weeks of training on action video games <unk> they actually perform better and the improvement is still there five months after having done the training <unk> that 's really really important <unk> why <unk> because i told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation we need to have effects that are going to be long lasting now at this point a number of you are probably wondering well what are you waiting for to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy  or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has five months after
