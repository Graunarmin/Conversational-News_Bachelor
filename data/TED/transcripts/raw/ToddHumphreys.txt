 <unk> something happened in the early morning hours of may 2nd two thousand  that had a profound effect on the way our society operates <unk>  ironically hardly anyone noticed at the time the change was silent <unk> imperceptible unless you knew exactly what to look <unk> for on that morning u s president bill clinton ordered that a special switch be thrown in the orbiting satellites of the global positioning system  instantaneously <unk> every civilian gps receiver around the globe went from errors the size of a football field to errors the size of a small <unk> it 's hard to overstate the effect that this change in accuracy has had on us  before this switch was thrown <unk> we didn 't have in car navigation systems giving turn by turn directions because back then gps couldn 't tell you what block you were on let alone what street  for geolocation accuracy matters <unk>  and things have only improved over the last ten years <unk> with more base stations more ground stations <unk> receivers and better algorithms gps can now not only tell you what street you are on but what part of the street  this level of accuracy has unleashed a firestorm of innovation  in fact <unk> many of you navigated here today with the help of your tomtom or your <unk> paper maps are becoming obsolete <unk> but we now stand on the verge of another revolution in geolocation accuracy what if i told you that the two meter positioning that our current cell phones and our our tomtoms give us is pathetic compared to what we could be getting  for some time now it 's been known that if you pay attention to the carrier phase of the gps signal <unk> and if you have an internet connection then you can go from meter level to centimeter level even millimeter level positioning <unk>  so why don 't we have this capability on our on our phones only i believe for a lack of imagination manufacturers haven 't built this carrier phase technique into their cheap gps chips because they 're not sure what the general public would do with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint the wrinkles in the palm of your <unk> hand <unk>  but you and i and other innovators we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy  imagine for example an augmented reality app that overlays a virtual world to millimeter level precision on top of the physical world  i could build for you a structure up here in 3d millimeter accurate that only you could see or my friends at home <unk> so this level of positioning this is what we 're looking for and i believe that within the next few years i predict that this kind of <unk> carrier phase based positioning will become cheap and ubiquitous and the consequences will be fantastic <unk> the holy <unk> of course is the gps dot do you remember the movie the da vinci code  here 's professor langdon examining a gps dot which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe <unk> but we know that in the world of nonfiction  the gps dot is impossible right <unk>  for one thing gps doesn 't work indoors and for <unk> they don 't make devices quite this small especially when those devices have to relay their measurements back over a network  well <unk> these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago <unk> but things have changed <unk>  there 's been a strong trend toward miniaturization better sensitivity <unk>  so much so that a few years ago a gps tracking device looked like this clunky box to the left of the keys <unk>  compare that with the device released just months ago that 's now packaged into something the size of a key <unk> fob <unk>  and if you take a look at the state of the art for a complete gps receiver which is only a centimeter on a side and more sensitive than ever you realize that the gps dot <unk> will soon move from fiction to nonfiction <unk>  imagine what we could do with a world full of gps <unk> it 's not just that you 'll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore or your child when you 're at disneyland  you 'll buy gps dots in bulk and you 'll stick them on everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars  i couldn 't find my shoes one recent morning and as usual had to ask my wife if she had seen them <unk>  but i shouldn 't have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality <unk>  i should be able to ask my house where my shoes are <unk> those of you who have made the switch to gmail remember how refreshing it was to go from organizing all of your email to simply searching it the gps dot will do the same for our possessions now of course there is a flip side to the gps dot i was in my office some months back and got a telephone call the <unk> woman on the other end of the line we 'll call her carol was panicked  apparently <unk> <unk> an ex boyfriend of carol 's from california had found her in texas and was following her around <unk>  so you might ask at this point why she 's calling you well so did i but it turned out there was a technical twist to carol 's case <unk> would show up at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations he was carrying an open laptop <unk>  and over time carol realized that he had planted a gps tracking device on her car <unk> so she was calling me for help to disable it  well you should go to a good mechanic and have him look at your car i said i already <unk> he didn 't see anything obvious <unk> and he said he 'd have to take the car apart piece by piece  well then you 'd better go to the the police i said i already have she replied  they 're not sure this rises to the level of harassment <unk> and they 're not set up technically to find the device  okay what about the fbi i 've talked to them too  and same story we then talked about her coming to my lab and us performing a radio sweep of her car but i wasn 't even sure that would work <unk>  given that some of these devices are configured to only transmit when they 're inside safe zones or when the car is moving  so there we were carol isn 't the first and certainly won 't be the last to find herself in this kind of fearsome environment <unk> worrisome situation caused by gps tracking in fact <unk> as i looked into her case i discovered to my surprise that it 's not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else 's car <unk>  the supreme court ruled last month that a policeman has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking <unk>  but the law isn 't clear about civilians doing this to one another so it 's not just big brother we have to worry about <unk> but big neighbor there is one alternative that carol could have taken very effective <unk> it 's called the wave bubble <unk>  it 's an open source gps jammer <unk> developed by limor fried a graduate student at <unk> and limor calls it a tool for reclaiming our personal space  with a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you within which gps signals can 't reside they get drowned out by the bubble <unk>  and limor designed this in part because like carol she felt threatened by gps tracking then she posted her design to the web <unk>  and if you don 't have time to build your own <unk> you can buy one chinese manufacturers now sell thousands of nearly identical <unk> devices on the internet  so you might be thinking the wave bubble sounds great <unk> i should have one might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car <unk>  but you should be aware that its use is very much illegal in the united states <unk> and why is that well because it 's not a bubble at all its jamming signals don 't stop at the edge of your personal space or at the edge of your car <unk> they go on to jam innocent gps receivers for miles around you laughter now if you 're carol or limor or someone who feels threatened by gps tracking <unk>  it might not feel wrong to turn on a wave bubble <unk>  but in fact <unk> the results can be disastrous <unk> imagine for example <unk> the captain of a cruise ship trying to make your way through a thick fog and some passenger in the back turns on a wave bubble all of a sudden your gps readout goes blank  and now it 's just you and the fog and whatever you can pull off the radar system if you remember how to work it  they in fact <unk> they don 't update or upkeep <unk> the only backup to gps was discontinued last year  our modern society has a special relationship with gps we 're almost blindly reliant on it it 's built deeply into our systems and infrastructure some call it the invisible utility  so turning on a wave bubble might not just cause inconvenience <unk> it might be deadly <unk> but as it turns out for purposes of protecting your privacy at the expense of general gps reliability <unk> there 's something even more potent and more subversive than a wave bubble <unk> and that is a gps spoofer <unk>  the idea behind the gps spoofer is simple <unk> instead of jamming the gps signals you fake them <unk> you imitate them and if you do it right the device you 're attacking doesn 't even know it 's being spoofed  so let me show you how this works  in any gps receiver there 's a peak inside that corresponds to the authentic signals these three red dots represent the tracking points that try to keep themselves centered on that peak  but if you send in a fake <unk> peak pops up <unk> and if you can get these two peaks perfectly aligned  the tracking points can 't tell the difference <unk> and they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal <unk> with the authentic peak getting forced off  at this point the game is over the fake signals now completely control this gps receiver <unk>  so is this really possible can someone really manipulate the timing and positioning of a gps receiver just like that with <unk> spoofer well the short answer is yes <unk>  the key is that civil gps signals are completely open <unk> they have no encryption <unk> they have no authentication they 're wide open vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack  even so up until very recently <unk> nobody worried about gps spoofers <unk> people figured that it would be too complex or too expensive for some hacker to build one <unk> but i and a friend of mine from graduate school we didn 't see it that way  we knew it wasn 't going to be so hard  and we wanted to be the first to build one so we could get out in front of the problem and help protect against gps spoofing  i remember vividly the week it all came together <unk> we built it at my home <unk> which means that i got a little extra help from my three year old son ramon <unk> here 's ramon looking for a little attention from dad that week  at first the spoofer was just a jumble of cables and computers <unk> though we eventually got it packaged into a small box now  the dr frankenstein moment  when the spoofer finally came alive and i glimpsed its awful potential came late one <unk> night when i tested the spoofer against my iphone <unk> let me show you some actual footage from that very first experiment  i had come to completely trust this little blue dot and its reassuring blue halo they seemed to speak to me they 'd say here you are  here you are  and you can trust us <unk> something felt very wrong about the world it was a sense almost of betrayal when this little blue dot started at my house  and went running off toward the north leaving me behind i wasn 't moving  what i then saw in this little moving blue dot was the potential for chaos <unk> <unk> i saw airplanes and ships veering off course with the captain learning only too late that something was wrong  i saw the <unk> gps derived timing of the new york stock exchange being manipulated by hackers <unk> you can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a gps spoofer <unk> spoofer <unk> it 's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of gps dots  imagine for example you 're being tracked well you can play the tracker for a fool pretending to be at work when you 're really on vacation  or if you 're carol you could lure your ex boyfriend into some empty parking lot where the police are waiting for him  so i 'm fascinated by this conflict <unk> looming conflict between privacy on the one hand and the need for a clean radio spectrum on the other we simply cannot tolerate gps jammers and spoofers <unk> and yet <unk>  given the lack of effective legal means for protecting our privacy from the gps dot can you really blame people for wanting <unk> to turn them on for wanting to use them <unk> i hold out hope that we 'll be able to reconcile this conflict with some sort of  some yet uninvented technology <unk>  but meanwhile <unk> grab some popcorn <unk> because things are going to get interesting <unk>  within the next few years <unk> many of you will be the proud owner of a gps dot <unk> maybe you 'll have a whole bag full of them <unk>  you 'll never lose track of your things <unk> again the gps dot will fundamentally reorder your life <unk>  but will you be able to resist the temptation to track your fellow man  or will you be able to resist the temptation to turn on a gps spoofer or a wave bubble to protect your own privacy  so as usual what we see just beyond the horizon is full of promise and peril it 'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out
