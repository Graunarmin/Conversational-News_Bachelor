 <unk> tina lord found herself in quite the pickle see this gold digger made sure she married sweet cord roberts just before he inherited millions  but when cord found out tina loved his money as much as she loved him he dumped her  cord 's mother maria was thrilled until <unk> they hooked up again <unk> so maria hired max holden to romance tina and then made sure cord didn 't find out tina was pregnant with his baby <unk>  so tina  still married but thinking cord didn 't love her flew to argentina with max cord finally figured out what was going on and rushed after them but he was too late  tina had already been kidnapped strapped to a <unk> raft and sent over a waterfall she and her baby were presumed dead cord was sad for a bit but then he bounced right back with a supersmart archaeologist named kate and they had a gorgeous wedding until tina <unk> seemingly back from the dead ran into the church holding a baby ladies and gentlemen is how the soap opera one life to live introduced a love story that lasted now if you 've ever seen a soap opera you know the stories and the characters can be exaggerated larger than life and if you 're a fan you find that exaggeration fun and if you 're not <unk>  find them melodramatic or unsophisticated maybe you think watching soap operas is a waste of time that their bigness means their lessons are small or nonexistent <unk>  but i believe the opposite to be true  soap operas reflect life just bigger <unk>  so there are real life lessons we can learn from soap operas and those lessons are as big and adventurous as any soap opera storyline  now i 've been a fan since i ran home from the bus stop in second grade desperate to catch the end of luke and laura 's wedding the biggest moment in general hospital history so you can imagine how much i loved my eight years as the assistant casting director on as the world turns my job was watching soap operas <unk> reading soap opera scripts and auditioning actors to be on <unk> and yes soap operas are larger than life drama on a grand scale but our lives can be filled with as much intensity and the stakes can feel just as dramatic  we cycle through tragedy and joy just like these characters we cross thresholds fight demons and find find salvation unexpectedly and we do it again and again and again but just like soaps <unk> we can flip the script <unk> which means we can learn from these characters that move <unk> <unk> like bumblebees <unk> looping and swerving through life and we can use those lessons to craft our own life stories  <unk> and most importantly they show us it 's never too late to change your story <unk>  so with that let 's start with soap opera lesson one surrender is not an option  all my children ' s erica kane was daytime 's version of scarlett o 'hara a hyperbolically self important princess who deep down was scrappy and daring <unk> on tv perhaps erica 's most famous scene is her alone in the woods suddenly face to face with a grizzly bear she screamed at the bear  you may not do this do you understand me <unk> you may not come near me <unk>  i am erica kane and you are a filthy beast  and of course the bear left <unk> so what that teaches us is <unk> obstacles are to be expected and we can choose to surrender or we can stand and fight <unk>  pandora 's tim westergren knows this better than most you might even call him the erica kane of silicon valley <unk>  tim and his cofounders launched the company with two million dollars in funding they were out of cash the next year <unk>  <unk> lots of companies fold at that point but tim chose to fight <unk> he maxed out eleven credit cards and racked up six figures in personal debt and it still wasn 't enough <unk>  so every two weeks for two years on payday he stood in front of his employees and he asked them to sacrifice their salaries <unk>  and it worked <unk> more than fifty people deferred two million dollars and now more than a decade later <unk> pandora is <unk> when you believe that there is a way around or through whatever is in front of you that surrender is not an option you can overcome enormous obstacles <unk>  which brings us to soap opera lesson two sacrifice your ego and drop the superiority complex <unk>  now this is scary it 's an acknowledgment of need or fallibility <unk> maybe it 's even an admission that we 're not as special as we might like to think stephanie forrester of the bold and the beautiful thought she was pretty darn special she thought she was so special she didn 't need to mix with the riffraff from the valley <unk> and she made sure valley girl brooke knew it  but after nearly twenty five years of epic fighting stephanie got sick and let brooke in  <unk> archenemies became soul mates and stephanie died in brooke 's arms and here 's our takeaway  drop your ego  life is not about you  it 's about us  and our ability to experience joy and love and to improve our reality comes only when we make ourselves vulnerable and we accept responsibility for our actions and our inactions <unk> kind of like howard schultz the ceo of starbucks  now after a great run as ceo howard stepped down in two thousand and starbucks quickly overextended itself and stock prices fell  howard rejoined the team in two thousand and eight and one of the first things he did was apologize to all one hundred and eighty thousand employees he apologized <unk> and then he asked for help <unk> and ideas in return <unk> and now <unk> starbucks has more than doubled its net revenue since howard came back  so sacrifice your desire to be right or safe all the time it 's not helping anyone least of all you  sacrifice your ego  soap opera lesson three evolution is real  you 're not meant to be static characters on television static equals boring and boring equals fired characters are supposed to grow and change  now on tv those dynamic changes can make for some rough transitions particularly when a character is played by one person yesterday and played by someone new today <unk>  recasting happens all the time on soaps over the last twenty years four different actors have played the same key role of carly <unk> benson on general hospital  each new face triggered a change in the character 's life and personality <unk> now there was always an essential nugget of carly in there  but the character and the story adapted to whomever was playing her <unk>  and here 's what that means for us <unk> while we may not swap faces in our own lives we can evolve too we can choose to <unk> draw a circle around our feet and stay in that spot  or we can open ourselves to opportunities like carly who went from nursing student to hotel owner  or like julia child <unk>  julia was a world war ii spy <unk>  and when the war ended she got married moved to france and decided to give culinary school a shot julia her books and <unk> her tv shows revolutionized the way america cooks  we all have the power to initiate change in our lives to evolve and adapt  we make the choice <unk> but sometimes life chooses for us and we don 't get a heads up surprise slams us in the face you 're flat on the ground the air is <unk> died of a stroke but not really because in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four he died when his car plunged into the harbor and yet he was back in <unk> him <unk> marlena shot him and he tumbled off a catwalk to his death <unk> and so it went for thirty years  even when we saw the body <unk> we knew better he 's called the phoenix for a reason <unk> and here 's what that means for us as long as the show is still on the air or you 're still breathing <unk> is permanent <unk> resurrection is possible <unk> now of course just like life soap operas do ultimately meet the big finale  cbs canceled my show as the world turns in december two thousand and nine and we shot our final episode in june two thousand and ten <unk> it was six months of dying and i rode that train right into the mountain <unk>  and even though we were in the middle of a huge recession and millions of people were struggling to find work  i somehow thought everything would be ok <unk> so i packed up the kids and the brooklyn apartment and we moved in with my in laws in <unk> watched the final episode air and i realized the show was not the only fatality <unk> i was one too <unk>  i was unemployed and living on the second floor of my in laws ' home <unk> and that 's enough to make anyone feel dead inside  but i knew my story wasn 't over that it couldn 't be over i just had to tap into everything i <unk> had ever learned about soap operas <unk>  i had to be brave like erica and refuse to surrender so every day <unk> i made a decision to fight <unk>  i had to be vulnerable like stephanie and sacrifice my ego <unk> i had to ask for help a lot of times across many states <unk>  i had to be adaptable like carly and evolve my skills my <unk> mindset and my circumstances <unk> and then i had to be resilient like stefano <unk> and resurrect myself and my career like a phoenix from the ashes <unk>  eventually i got an interview  after fifteen years in news and entertainment nine months of unemployment and this one interview <unk>  i had an offer for an entry level job <unk> was thirty seven years old and i was back from the dead <unk> we will all experience what looks like an ending <unk> and we can choose to make it a beginning <unk>  kind of like tina  who miraculously survived that waterfall and because i hate to leave a cliffhanger hanging tina and cord did get divorced <unk>  but they got remarried three times before the show went off the air in so remember as long as there is breath in your body <unk> it 's never too late to change your story  thank you
