 <unk> i was living in a tiny house behind someone else 's house in los angeles it was this guest house it had <unk> kind of been dilapidated not taken care of for a long time <unk> and one night i was sitting there and i got this really spooky feeling kind of the feeling like you 're being watched <unk>  but no one was there except my two dogs and they were just chewing their feet <unk> <unk> just my imagination <unk> but the feeling just kept getting worse and i started to feel this this pressure in my chest <unk> sort of like the feeling when you get bad news <unk> but it started to sink lower and lower and almost hurt <unk> and over the course of that week this feeling got worse and worse <unk> and i started to become convinced that something was there in my little guest house haunting me <unk>  and i started to hear these sounds  this whoosh kind of whisper like something passing through me <unk> <unk> i don 't think you 're crazy <unk> i think you just need to do a cleansing ritual <unk> get some sage and burn it and tell it to go away so i said ok and i went and i bought sage i had never done this before so i set the sage on fire <unk> waved it about and said go away  this is my house <unk> i live here you don <unk> but the feeling stayed nothing got better <unk> and then i started to think ok well now this thing is probably just laughing at me <unk> because it hasn 't left <unk> and i probably just look like this impotent powerless thing that couldn 't get it to go away so every day i 'd come home and you guys this feeling got <unk> laughing at it now but i would i would sit there in bed and cry every night <unk> and the feeling on my chest got worse and worse <unk> it was was physically painful <unk> and i even went to a psychiatrist and tried to get her to prescribe me medicine <unk> and she wouldn 't just because i <unk> so finally i got on the internet <unk> and i googled hauntings  and i came upon this forum of ghost hunters but these were a special kind of ghost hunters they were skeptics they believed that every case of ghosts that they had investigated so far had been explained away by science <unk> and i was like <unk> this is what 's happening to me <unk> and if you have an explanation for me <unk> i would love to hear it and one of them said ok um  have you heard of carbon monoxide poisoning <unk> leak leaking into your home i looked it up and the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include a pressure on your chest <unk> auditory hallucinations whoosh and an unexplained feeling of dread <unk>  <unk> so that night i called the gas company i said i have an emergency i need you to come out i don 't want to get into the story now but i need you to come out  they came out i said i suspect a gas leak  they brought their carbon monoxide detector <unk>  and the man said it 's a really good thing that you called us tonight <unk> because you could have been dead very soon <unk> haunted houses <unk> and i wonder how many of them have been in one and how many of them have been in danger <unk>  so that haunting story has led me to my job <unk> i 'm an investigator and i 'm an investigator in two senses i 'm an investigative <unk> and i 'm also an investigator of the claims of the paranormal and claims of the spiritual <unk> and that means a few things <unk> sometimes that means that i 'm pretending to need an exorcism so i can get yes that 's right so i can go to an exorcist and see if he 's using gimmicks or psychological tricks to try to convince someone that they 're possessed  sometimes that means i 'm going undercover in a fringe group which i report on for a podcast that i <unk> i 've done over seventy investigations like this with my co host ross <unk> i would love to tell you that nine times out of ten science wins saves the day it 's all explained that 's not true <unk> the truth is  ten times out of ten science wins it saves the day <unk> mean there 's no such thing as a mystery of course there are mysteries <unk> but a mystery is a mystery <unk> it is not a ghost <unk>  now <unk> i believe there are two kinds of truth <unk> me a while to get to this place <unk> but i think this is right so hear me out i think there is outer truth and there 's inner truth <unk> so if you say to me  there was a man named jesus and he once existed  that 's outer truth right <unk> and we can go and look at the historical record we can determine whether that seems to be true <unk>  and i would argue <unk> it does seem to be true <unk> i would say that 's an outer truth claim <unk> because he physically rose or he didn 't i 'm not going to get into whether he rose or he didn 't  but i would say that 's an outer truth claim it happened or it didn 't happen but if you say i don 't care whether he rose from the dead it 's symbolically important to me <unk> and that metaphor <unk> is so meaningful so purposeful to me <unk> and i 'm not going to try to persuade you of it  now you 've moved it from outer truth to inner truth from science to art <unk> and i think we have a tendency to not be clear about this to try to move our inner truths to outer truths  or to not be fair about it to each other and when people are telling us their inner truths to try to make them defend them by <unk> 'm talking here about outer truth about objective things and there was an objective reality in my haunted house right <unk> now that i 've told you about the gas leak <unk> i doubt a single person here would be like i still think there was a ghost too  because as soon as we have these scientific explanations <unk> we know to give up the ghost <unk> we use these things as <unk> for things that we can 't explain we don 't believe them because of evidence <unk> we believe them because of a lack of evidence so there is a group in los angeles called the independent investigations group or the iig and they do great work they 'll give a $ ten thousand prize to anyone who can show <unk> under scientific <unk> that they have a paranormal ability no one 's done it yet <unk> but they 've had a couple people who claim that they were clairaudients which means that they can hear voices either from the great beyond or they can read minds <unk>  and they had one person who was very sincere who believed that he could he could read minds <unk> so they set up a test with him <unk> this is the way it always works the group says ok we have a protocol we have a way to scientifically test this do you agree with it the person says yes <unk> then they test it it 's very important that both sides agree  they did that they tested him they said ok <unk> you know what  you weren 't able to predict what lisa was thinking <unk>  it matched up about the same as chance looks like you don 't have the power and that gave them the opportunity to compassionately sit down with him and have a very difficult discussion which basically amounted to hey <unk>  we know you 're sincere <unk> and what that means is  you do hear something in your head and that guy got to make the very difficult decision <unk> but really the <unk> <unk> decision about whether to go get help we 're actually helping people <unk> these these connections that maybe before seemed like otherworldly explanations <unk> help draw us into reality and maybe change our lives for the better <unk>  now on the other hand <unk> maybe one time it 'll turn out to be true <unk>  <unk> respect them enough to ask these good questions challenge and see how you can examine them together <unk> because there 's this idea that you can 't respect <unk> a belief and still challenge it but that 's not true <unk> when we jiggle the lock when we test the claim we 're saying ok i respect you i 'm listening to what you 're saying i 'm going to test it out with you we 've all had that experience where you 're telling someone something and oh that 's really interesting yeah you know you 're being had but when someone says really huh  sounds a little sketchy to me <unk> you at least know you 're being engaged and respected <unk> and that 's the kind of attitude we should have with these claims that 's showing someone that you care what they 're saying <unk> most of these searches will come up empty <unk> but that 's how all of science works every cure for cancer so far has not panned out <unk> but we don 't stop looking <unk> for two reasons because number one the answer matters whether it 's looking at the afterlife or the paranormal or the cure for cancer it all amounts to the same question <unk> how long will we be here and two <unk> because looking for the truth  being open minded and being willing to be wrong and to change your whole worldview is i still get excited at ghost stories every single time i still consider that every group i join might be right and i hope i never lose that hope let 's all never lose that hope because searching for what 's out there helps us understand what 's in here <unk> and also please have a carbon monoxide detector in your
