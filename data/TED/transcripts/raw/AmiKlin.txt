 <unk> always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement to resonate other people 's feelings <unk> thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them <unk> as a scientist i always wanted to measure that resonance  that sense of the other that happens so quickly in the blink of an eye  we intuit other people 's feelings <unk> we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen  we 're always in this stance of being the object of somebody else 's subjectivity <unk> we do that all the time we just can 't shake it off <unk>  it 's so important that the very tools we use to understand ourselves to understand the world around us are shaped by that stance we are social to the core <unk>  so my journey in autism really started when i lived in a residential unit for adults with autism <unk> most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long stay hospitals this is a long <unk> for them autism was devastating <unk>  they had profound intellectual disabilities <unk> they didn 't talk but most of all <unk>  they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them from their environment and from the people in fact at the time if you walked into a school for individuals with autism you 'd hear a lot of noise <unk>  <unk> commotion actions people doing things <unk> but they 're always doing things by themselves <unk>  so they may be looking at a light in the ceiling <unk> or they may be isolated in the corner  or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements  <unk> now we know that autism is this disruption the disruption of this resonance that i am telling you about these are survival skills these are survival skills that we inherited over many many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution you see babies are born in a state of utter fragility <unk> without the caregiver they wouldn 't survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival they orient to the caregiver from the first days and weeks of life <unk> babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment <unk> they prefer to look at people rather than at things and even as they 're looking at people they look at people 's eyes <unk> because the eye is the window to the other person 's experiences <unk> so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away <unk>  well <unk> they orient to the caregiver <unk> the caregiver seeks the baby and it 's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind the <unk> social mind the social brain depends on <unk> we always think about autism as as something that happens later on in life <unk>  it doesn 't it begins with the beginning of life <unk> as babies engage with <unk> they soon realize that well there is something between the ears that is very important it 's invisible you can 't see it but it 's really critical <unk>  and that thing is called attention and they learn soon enough even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want they also learn to follow other people 's gazes <unk> because whatever people are looking at is <unk> they are thinking about <unk>  and soon enough <unk> they start to learn about the meaning of things <unk>  because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something they 're not just getting a directional cue <unk>  they are getting the other person 's meaning of that thing the attitude <unk> and soon <unk> they start building this body of meanings <unk> but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction  those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others <unk>  well <unk>  this is a <unk> little girl <unk> and she has autism and i am coming so close to her that i am maybe two inches from her <unk> face <unk>  and she 's quite oblivious to me <unk> imagine if i did that to you came two inches from your face you 'd do probably two things wouldn 't you you would recoil you would call the police  you would do something because it 's literally impossible to penetrate somebody 's physical space and not get that reaction we do so remember intuitively effortlessly this is our body wisdom <unk> by our language our body just knows that <unk>  and we 've known that for a long time <unk> and this is not something that happens to humans only <unk> it happens to some of our phyletic cousins <unk>  because if you 're a monkey <unk>  and you look at another monkey <unk> and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be a signal or threat well you <unk> not going to be alive for long <unk> so something that in other species are survival mechanisms <unk> without which they wouldn 't basically live we bring into the context of human beings <unk> and this is what we need to simply act socially  now she is oblivious to me and i 'm so close to her and you think <unk> maybe she can see you maybe she can hear you well a few minutes later <unk> she goes to the corner of the room <unk> and she finds a tiny little piece of candy an m & m so i could not attract her attention <unk> but something a thing did  now most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people  <unk> for this girl that division line is not so clear  and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging  moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic the brain determines who <unk> to be but in fact the brain also becomes who we are and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction  this is what 's happening with her mind <unk> and this is what 's happening with her brain  well autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders and it 's a brain disorder it 's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born <unk> we now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism <unk> there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted there are those individuals who don 't talk <unk> those individuals who talk too much  there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school  you see them running the periphery fence all the school day if you let them  to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly relentlessly <unk> but often in an awkward fashion <unk> without that immediate resonance <unk>  well <unk> this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time when i started in this field we thought there were four individuals with autism <unk> per ten thousand a very rare condition <unk>  well <unk> now we <unk> know it 's more like one in one hundred there are millions of individuals with autism all around us <unk> the societal cost of this condition is huge  in the us alone maybe thirty five to eighty billion dollars <unk> and you know what most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely <unk> disabled individuals who need wraparound services services that are very very intensive and those services can cost in excess of sixty thousand to eighty thousand dollars a year  those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment <unk> because now we know that autism creates itself as individuals diverge in that pathway of learning that i mentioned to you were we to be able to identify <unk> this condition at an earlier point <unk> and intervene and treat i can tell you this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past ten years <unk> this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition  also we have a window of opportunity <unk> because the brain is malleable for just so long <unk> and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life <unk> not that that window closes <unk> it doesn 't <unk>  but it diminishes considerably  and yet <unk> the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years <unk>  and in disadvantaged populations the populations that don 't have access to clinical services rural populations <unk> minorities  <unk> the age of diagnosis is later still  which is almost as if i were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe <unk>  so i feel that we have a bioethical imperative <unk> the science is there  but no science is of relevance if it doesn 't have an impact on the community and we just can 't afford that missed opportunity <unk> because children with autism become adults with autism <unk> and we feel that those things we can do for these children for those families early on <unk> will have lifetime consequences for the child for the family <unk> and for the community at large <unk>  so this is our view of autism <unk>  there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism in fact we believe there are going to be something between three hundred and six hundred genes associated with autism and genetic anomalies much more than just genes <unk>  and we actually have a bit of a question here <unk>  because if there are so many different causes of autism <unk> how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome because people like myself when we walk into a playroom <unk> we recognize a child as having autism <unk> so how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity <unk>  and the answer is what lies in between <unk>  which is development and in fact <unk> we are very interested in those first two years of life <unk>  because those liabilities don 't necessarily convert into autism autism creates itself  were we to be able to intervene during those years of life we might attenuate for some and god knows <unk> maybe even prevent for others <unk>  so how do we do that how do we enter that feeling of resonance how do we enter another person 's being  i remember when i interacted with that <unk> how do you come into her world is she thinking about me is she thinking about <unk> it 's hard to do that so we had to create the technologies <unk> we had to basically step inside a body we had to see the world through her eyes  and so in the past many years we 've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking <unk> we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with this is my colleague warren jones with whom we 've been building these methods these studies for the past twelve years <unk> and you see there little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from <unk> his world his mom the caregiver <unk> but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his in his daycare <unk>  what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory but in order for us to do that  we had to create these very sophisticated measures measures of how people how little babies  how newborns engage with the world moment by moment  what is important and what is not <unk> well <unk> we created those measures and here what you see is what we call a funnel of attention you 're watching a video those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of thirty five typically developing two year olds  and we freeze one frame <unk>  and this is what the typical children are doing in this scan pass in green here are two year olds with autism <unk> so on that frame <unk> the children who are typical are watching this  the emotion of expression of that little boy as he 's fighting a little bit with the little girl <unk>  what are the children with autism doing they are focusing on the revolving door opening <unk> and shutting  well i can tell you that this divergence that you 're seeing here doesn 't happen only in our five minute experiment <unk>  it happens moment by moment in their real lives  and their minds are being formed and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers <unk> well <unk> we took a construct from <unk> the concept of growth charts you know when you take a child to the pediatrician and you have physical height and weight well we decided we were going to create growth charts of social engagement <unk> we sought children from the time they 're born what you see here on the <unk> their viewing time that they 're focusing on people 's eyes and this is their growth chart <unk>  they start over here they love people 's eyes and it remains quite stable it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months now let 's see what 's happening with babies who became autistic  it 's something very different <unk> it starts way up here <unk> but then it 's a free fall <unk> very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people but it has no traction <unk> it 's almost as if that stimulus you you 're not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives <unk> wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life <unk> because if you interact with a two and a three month old you 'd be surprised by how social those babies are  and what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily <unk> and using these kinds of measures and many others <unk> what we found out is that our science could in fact <unk> identify this condition early on we didn 't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life  if we measured things that are evolutionarily <unk> highly conserved <unk>  and developmentally very early emerging things that are online from the first weeks of life we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months and that what we are doing now  now we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children <unk>  but this would be for naught if we didn 't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community  now we want those devices of course to be deployed by those who are in the trenches our colleagues <unk> the primary care physicians <unk> who see every child and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice <unk> because they have to see so many children <unk>  and we want to do that universally so that we don 't miss any child <unk> but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure <unk> for intervention for treatment <unk> we need to be able to work with the families support the families to manage those first years with them we need to be able to really go from universal screening to universal access to treatment <unk> because those treatments are going to change these children 's and those families <unk> ' lives <unk> now <unk> when we think about what we [ can ] do in those first years i can tell you <unk> having been in this field for so long one feels really rejuvenated there is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities preventing in fact those experiences that i really started in my journey in this field i thought at the time that this was an <unk> intractable condition no longer <unk> we can do a great deal of things  and the idea is not to cure autism that 's not the idea  what we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times <unk>  the profound intellectual disabilities <unk> the lack of language <unk> the profound profound isolation we feel that individuals with autism in fact have a very special perspective on the world and we need diversity <unk>  and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength <unk> predictable situations situations that can be defined <unk> because after all  they learn about the world almost like about it <unk> than learning how to function in it <unk> but this is a strength if you 're working for example in technology <unk>  and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities <unk> we want them to be free to do that we want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise <unk> well thank you for listening to me
