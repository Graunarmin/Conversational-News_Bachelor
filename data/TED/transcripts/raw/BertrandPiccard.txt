 <unk> i learned a lot of things about ballooning especially at the end of these balloon flights around the world i did with brian jones when i took this picture  the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night <unk> and on the other side there was a rising sun so you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown you have the <unk> for the people who don 't dare to go through the ice there are so many people who prefer to suffer in the ice they know instead of taking the risk of going through the ice to see what there is on the other side and i think that 's one of the main problems of our society <unk>  we learn <unk> maybe not the famous ted audience but so many other people learn <unk>  that the unknown <unk> the doubts the question marks are dangerous <unk>  and we have to resist to the changes <unk> we have to keep everything under control  well the unknown is part of life <unk> in that sense ballooning is a beautiful metaphor  because in the balloon like in life  we go very well in unforeseen directions we want to go in a direction but the winds push us in another direction like in life <unk>  and as long as we fight horizontally <unk>  against life <unk>  <unk> against what 's happening to us life is a nightmare  how do we steer a balloon by understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction  so then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory in life <unk> or in the balloon we have to change altitude <unk>  <unk> in life that means raising to another psychological philosophical spiritual level <unk>  but how do we do that  in ballooning <unk> or in life how do we change altitude <unk> how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day  well in a balloon it 's easy we have ballast <unk> and when we drop the ballast overboard we <unk> all the equipment we don 't need anymore <unk> and i think in life it should be exactly like this you know when people speak about pioneering spirit  very often they believe that pioneers are the ones who have new ideas <unk>  it 's not true <unk> the pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas because new ideas are so easy to have we just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas <unk>  no <unk> the pioneer is the one who allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast habits certainties convictions <unk> exclamation marks  paradigms dogmas <unk> and when we are able to do that what happens  life is not anymore just one line going in one direction <unk> life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions in three dimensions <unk>  and pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore this vertical axis  of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon but in life itself  explore this vertical axis that means explore all the different ways to do all the different ways to behave all the different ways to think <unk> before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish <unk>  this is very practical <unk> this can be in politics <unk>  this can be in spirituality <unk> this can be in environment in finance in education of children <unk> i deeply believe that life is a much greater adventure if we manage to do politics without the trench between the left and the right wing because we will throw away these political dogmas <unk>  i deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment if we get rid if we throw overboard this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past <unk> and that we can aim for much higher spirituality if we get rid of the religious dogmas <unk>  throwing overboard as ballast to <unk> change our direction <unk> well these basically are things i believed in such a long time but actually i had to go around the world in a balloon to be invited to talk about it it 's clear that it 's not easy to know which ballast to drop and which altitude to take sometime we need friends family members <unk> or a psychiatrist well in balloons we need weather men  the one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind at which altitude <unk> in order to help the balloonist but sometimes it 's very paradoxical  when brian jones and i were flying around the world <unk>  the weather man asked us one day to fly quite <unk> and very slow <unk> and when we calculated we thought we 're never going to make it around the world at that speed  so we disobeyed we flew much higher <unk> and double the speed <unk>  and i was so proud to have found that jetstream that i called the weather man and i told him hey guy don 't you think we 're good pilots up there  we fly twice the speed you predicted  and he told me don 't do that go down immediately in order to slow <unk> going to do that we don 't have enough gas to fly so slow  and he told me yes but with the low pressure you have on your left if you fly too fast in a couple of hours you will turn left and end up at the north pole  and then he asked me and this is something i will never forget in my life he just asked me you 're the good pilot up there what do you really want <unk> you want to go very fast in the wrong direction <unk> or slowly in the good direction and this is why you need weathermen <unk>  this is why you need people with long term vision <unk>  and this is precisely what fails in the political visions we have now in the political governments we are burning as you heard <unk> so <unk> not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life cannot last for long  so we went down actually we slowed down <unk> and we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel forty five thousand kilometers  but we were expected to have doubts we 're <unk> to have fears and actually this is where the adventure really started  when we were flying over the sahara and india it was nice holidays we could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane  in the middle of the pacific when you don 't have the good winds <unk> you cannot land <unk> you cannot go back that 's a crisis <unk> that 's the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking that 's the moment when you have to motivate <unk> that 's when you throw out all the ballast all the certainties <unk> in order to adapt to the new situation <unk>  and actually we changed completely our flight plan we changed completely our strategy <unk> and after twenty days we landed successfully in egypt <unk>  but if i show you this picture it 's not to tell you how happy we were it 's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles <unk>  we took off with three point seven tons of <unk> liquid propane <unk> we landed with forty kilos  when i saw that i made a promise to myself <unk>  i made a promise that the next time i would fly around the world <unk> it would be with no fuel  independent from fossil energies <unk> in order to be <unk> not to be threatened by the fuel gauge <unk> i had no idea how it was possible i just thought it 's a dream and i want to do it <unk>  and when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the air and space museum in washington together with the airplane of charles lindbergh with apollo eleven with the wright brothers ' flyer with chuck yeager 's sixty one  i had really a thought then i thought well the 20th century that was brilliant <unk> it allowed to do all those things there <unk> it will not be possible in the future any more  it takes too much energy  it will cost too much it will be prohibited because we 'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now <unk> so how can we perpetuate this pioneering spirit with something that will be independent from fossil energy <unk> and this is when the project solar impulse really started to <unk> turn in my head <unk>  and i think it 's a nice metaphor also for the 21st century  pioneering spirit should continue <unk> but on another level not to conquer the planet or space  not anymore it has been done <unk> but rather to improve the quality of life how can we go through the ice of certainty in order to make the most incredible a possible thing <unk> what is today completely impossible get rid of our dependency on fossil energy  if you tell to people we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world people will laugh at you except here <unk> where crazy people are invited to speak  so the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar powered airplane <unk> no fuel nobody ever could say in the future that it 's impossible to do it for cars for heating systems for computers and so on and so on  well solar power airplanes are not new they have flown in the past but without saving capabilities without batteries which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it if we want to show the potential we have to fly day and night <unk>  that means to load the batteries during the flight <unk> in order to spend the night on the batteries  and fly the next day again <unk> it has been made already on remote controlled little airplane models without pilots but it stays an anecdote because the public couldn 't identify to it <unk> i think you need a pilot in the plane that can talk to the universities that can talk to students talk to politicians during the flight and really make it a human adventure  for that unfortunately <unk> four meters wingspan is not enough you need sixty four meter wingspan sixty four meter wingspan to carry one <unk> the batteries flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency  why that because fuel is not easy to replace <unk> that 's for sure <unk>  and with two hundred square meters of solar power on our plane we can produce the same energy than two hundred little lightbulbs <unk> that means a christmas tree a big <unk> so the question is how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big christmas tree  people will tell you it 's impossible and that 's exactly why we try to do it <unk>  we launched the project with my colleague andre borschberg six years ago  we have now seventy people in the team working on it <unk> we have gone through the stages <unk> the construction of the first prototype that has been achieved after two years of work <unk>  cockpit <unk> propeller <unk> engine just the fuselage here it 's so light it 's not designed by an artist but it could be fifty kilos for the entire fuselage couple of kilos more for the wing spars <unk>  this is the complete structure of the airplane and one month ago we have unveiled it you <unk> imagine how it is for a team who has been working six years on it to show that it 's not only a dream and a vision <unk> it 's a real airplane  a real airplane that we could finally present <unk> and what 's the goal now the goal is to take off  end of this year for the first test <unk> but mainly <unk> take off on our own power without additional help without being towed climb to nine thousand meters altitude  the same time we load the batteries <unk> we run the engines <unk> and when we get at the maximum height <unk>  we arrive at the beginning of the night <unk>  and there there will be just one goal just one reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty <unk> and this is exactly the symbol of our world  if our airplane is too heavy if the pilot wastes energy we 'll never make it through the night <unk>  and in our world if we keep on spoiling wasting our energy resources if we keep on building things that consume so much energy that most of the companies now go bankrupt  it 's clear that we 'll never give the planet to the next <unk> generation without a major problem  so you see that this airplane is more a symbol i don 't think it will transport two hundred people in the next years  but when lindbergh crossed the atlantic <unk> the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel <unk>  and twenty years later there were two hundred people in every airplane crossing the atlantic so we have to start <unk> and show the example <unk> bit like on this picture here this is a painting from magritte in the museum in holland that i love so much  it 's a pipe <unk> and it 's written this is not a pipe  this is not an airplane <unk>  this is a symbol of what we can achieve when we believe in the impossible when we have a team <unk> when we have pioneering spirit <unk> and especially when we understand that all the certainties we have should be thrown overboard what pleases me very much is that in the beginning i thought that we would have to fly around the world with no fuel in order to have our message been understood  and more and more we 're invited around the world with andre to talk about that project to talk about the symbol of it invited by politicians invited in energy forums <unk> to show that it 's not anymore completely stupid to think about getting rid of the dependency on fossil energies  so through speeches like this one today through interviews through meetings  our goal is to get as many people possible on the team <unk>  the success will not <unk> fly around the world in a solar powered airplane no <unk> the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life  save energy  go to renewables <unk> and this is possible you know with the technologies we have today  we can save between thirty and fifty percent of the energy of a country in europe <unk>  and we can solve half of the rest with renewables <unk> it leaves <unk> or thirty percent for oil gas coal <unk> nuclear or whatever <unk> this is acceptable <unk> this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team you can just go on <unk> subscribe to just be informed of what we 're doing but much more to get advices to give your comments to spread the word that if it 's possible in the air  of course it 's possible in the ground <unk>  and each time we have some ice in the future we have to know that life will be great <unk> and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice to go through the obstacle to go through the problem <unk> in order to see what there is on the other side <unk> so you see this is what we 're doing on our side <unk> everyone has his goal has his dreams has his visions
