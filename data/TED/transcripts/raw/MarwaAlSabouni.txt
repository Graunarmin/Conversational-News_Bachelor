 <unk> six years of war homs is now a half destroyed city  my family and i were lucky our place is still standing <unk>  although for two years <unk> we were like prisoners at home <unk> outside there were demonstrations and battles and bombings and snipers <unk>  my husband and i used to run an architecture studio in the old town main <unk> large parts of homs have been more or less quiet <unk>  the economy is completely broken and people are still fighting <unk> the merchants who had stalls in the old city market now trade out of sheds on the streets  under our apartment <unk> all sorts of jobs to get by when i look at my destroyed city of course i ask myself what has led to this senseless war syria was largely a place of tolerance historically accustomed <unk> how did my country a country with communities living harmoniously together and comfortable in discussing their differences how did it degenerate into civil war violence <unk> displacement and unprecedented sectarian hatred <unk> there were many reasons that had led to the war social political and economic  <unk> there is one key reason that has been overlooked and which is <unk> important to analyze because from it will largely depend whether we can make sure that this doesn 't happen again  and that reason is architecture architecture in my country has played an important role in creating directing and and amplifying conflict between <unk> warring factions and this is probably true for other <unk> key role in whether a community crumbles or comes together syrian society has long lived the coexistence of different traditions and backgrounds syrians have experienced the prosperity of open trade they have enjoyed the true meaning <unk> in the mosques and churches built <unk> back to back in the interwoven souks and public venues and the proportions and sizes based on principles of humanity and harmony this architecture of mixity can still be read in the remains the old islamic city in syria was built over a multilayered past <unk> integrating with it and embracing its spirit  so did its communities people lived and worked with each other in a place that gave them a sense of belonging and made them feel at home they shared a remarkably unified existence but over the last century <unk> gradually this delicate balance of these places has been interfered with  first by the urban planners of the colonial period when the french went enthusiastically about transforming what they saw as the un modern syrian cities they blew up city <unk> urbanism and architecture of our cities assured identity and belonging not by <unk> <unk> by intertwining but over time the ancient became worthless <unk> and the new coveted the harmony of the built environment and social environment got trampled over by <unk> urbanism that zoned communities by class <unk> creed or affluence <unk> and the same was happening to the community as the shape of the built environment changed so the lifestyles and sense of belonging of the communities also started changing  from a register of togetherness of belonging architecture became a way of differentiation <unk> and communities started drifting apart from the <unk> very fabric that used to unite them and from the soul of the place that used to represent their common existence <unk> while many reasons had led to the syrian war we <unk> losing the sense of belonging to a place and a sense of sharing it with someone else has made it a lot easier to destroy <unk>  <unk> areas without proper infrastructure made of endless rows of bare block boxes containing people  people who mostly belonged to the same group whether based on religion <unk>  <unk> that used to bind the city together whether they were social through <unk> me an aside  when i read about heterogeneous urbanism in other parts of the world  involving ethnic neighborhoods in british cities or around paris or brussels <unk> i recognize the beginning of the kind of instability we have witnessed so disastrously here in syria  we have severely destroyed cities <unk> the war will end <unk> and the question that as an architect <unk> i have to ask is  how do we rebuild <unk>  what are the principles that we should adopt in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes  from my point of view <unk> the main focus should be on creating places that make <unk> need to recapture some of the traditional values that did just that creating the conditions for coexistence and peace values of beauty that don 't exhibit ostentation but rather  approachability and ease <unk>  moral values that promote generosity and acceptance architecture that is for everyone to enjoy <unk> not just for the elite just as used to be in the shadowed alleys of the old islamic city <unk>  mixed designs that encourage a sense of community there is a neighborhood here in homs that 's called baba amr that has been fully destroyed  almost two years ago i introduced this design into a un habitat competition for rebuilding it  the idea was to create an urban fabric inspired by a tree capable of growing and spreading organically <unk> echoing <unk> parking and playing and leisure trees and shaded areas it 's far from perfect <unk> obviously i drew it during the few hours of electricity we get and there are many possible ways to express belonging and community through architecture but compare it with the freestanding <unk> disconnected <unk> the coherent urbanism of the old islamic city <unk> while rows of soulless housing or tower blocks even when they are luxurious tend to promote isolation and otherness  even simple things like shaded places or fruit plants or drinking water inside the city can make a difference in how people feel towards the place  and whether they consider it a generous place that gives a place <unk> in order for a place to give its architecture should be giving too  our built environment matters the fabric of our cities is reflected in the fabric of our souls <unk>  and whether in the shape of informal concrete slums or broken social housing or trampled old towns <unk> the contemporary urban archetypes that have emerged all across the middle east have been one cause of the alienation and fragmentation of our communities  we can learn from this we can learn how to rebuild in another way how to create an architecture that doesn 't contribute only to the practical and economic aspects of people 's lives but also to their social spiritual <unk> we need to create again cities that are shared by the communities that inhabit them  if we do so people will not feel the need to seek identities opposed to the other identities all around <unk> because they will all feel at home
