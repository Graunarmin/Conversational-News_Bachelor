 <unk> what i wanted to do is to show the world that the little things can be the biggest things we all seem to think that  you know if we look down on the ground there 's nothing there <unk> and we use the word nothing  nothing doesn <unk> because there is always something my mother told me that <unk> when i was a child that i should always respect the little things <unk> what made me do this work i shall go into my my story this all started when i was age five <unk> what made me do it <unk> at school <unk> i will admit this academically i couldn 't express myself so i was  <unk> my world was seen as less <unk> so i decided i didn 't really want to be a part of that world <unk> i thought i need to retreat into something else <unk> so when my mother used to take me to school she thought i was at school and i used to do a u turn when her back was turned and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden <unk> now the one time i was in the shed and my mother suspected something thinking i was at school  my mother was like the woman in tom and jerry <unk> so you 'd just see her feet  <unk> i was hiding in the shed like that and all of a sudden <unk>  and then i saw her legs <unk> and then she said grabbed me like that because my mother was quite big and she lifted me up and she says how come you 're not at school i told her i couldn 't face it because the <unk> the teacher was treating me ridiculing me and using me as an example of failure so i told her at that age <unk> obviously i couldn 't express it that way but i told her i didn 't feel right <unk>  and then she just said you 're going back to school tomorrow and walked off and i didn 't expect that <unk> because i expected one of these <unk> but i didn 't get it so i 'm <unk> as i looked down on the ground <unk> i noticed there was some ants running around and i went into this little fantasy world and i thought these ants  are they looking for the queen ant or do they need somewhere to live so i thought perhaps if i made these ants some <unk> so i did <unk>  and how i set about that i got some splinters of wood and i sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass <unk> constructed this little apartment <unk>  well it looked like a little shanty shed when i 'd finished but i thought perhaps the ant won 't know it 'll probably move in so they did that was a bit crude at the time and i made all these little apartments and little merry go rounds seesaws and swings little ladders <unk>  and then i encouraged the ants to come ' round by putting sugar and things like that <unk>  and then i sat down and all the ants came along and all i could hear was is this for us and they moved in and decided not to pay me any rent <unk> this world that we can 't see <unk> so i realized that there was more to life than just everything that we see around us that 's huge so i started to educate myself on this molecular level <unk>  and as i as i got older i continued i showed my mother my mother told me to take it smaller <unk> now i shall show you something here explain as you can see <unk>  that 's a pinhead <unk> me to do this was a gentleman called peter huf and he says to me willard can you put my house on a pinhead  so i say how are you going to fit in there  and then he said to me i don 't believe you can do it can you really do it and i says try me and then he said but i don 't believe that you can do this so i said  ok so to cut a long story short i went home went underneath the microscope <unk> and i crushed up a piece of glass <unk> crushed it up and underneath <unk> underneath the microscope there were splinters of glass some of them were quite jagged <unk>  so i was crushing up these pieces of glass <unk> which as you can see that 's the actual frame of the house <unk> and the actual roof is made up of a fiber which i found in my sister 's old teddy bear  so i got the teddy bear and i said do you mind if i pull out one of your fibers so i did <unk> and i looked at it beneath the microscope and some of <unk> it was flat so i decided to slice these up with the tool that i make by i sharpen the the end of a needle into a blade <unk> and then i i actually slow down my whole nervous system <unk> and then i work between my heartbeat <unk> move and at the same time i have to watch i don 't inhale my own work at the same time  because that has happened to me  so what i did like i said come back to the glass <unk> i found these little <unk> bits of glass <unk> and i had to make them square <unk> so i 'm thinking how can i do this so what i did i got an oilstone broke the edge of an oilstone off  and what i did i took pieces of glass and i started to rub them <unk> i used a little tweezer which i made from a hair clip <unk>  and i built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn 't crush the <unk> and then i started rubbing very very gently  till some of the edges were quite square <unk>  and then i constructed it and how i constructed it is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead <unk> and then pushing the glass in with its own friction <unk>  and as i was doing it <unk> what happened the instrument that i used turned into a catapult <unk> and it went like <unk> huf isn 't going to be very happy when i told him his house has gone to another into the atmosphere somewhere  so to cut the story short i decided that i had to go back and do it so i found some more and i decided to sort of construct <unk> my breath working between my heartbeat <unk> and making sure everything is leveled because it 's such a a small sculpture <unk> nothing can can go wrong <unk> and i decided to build it up then i used fibers out of my jumper <unk> which i held and stretched and made the beams going around the house <unk> and the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed i used a money spider 's web to actually attach certain things <unk> things which sent me insane but i managed to do it and when i finished it <unk> i came back the next day i noticed that the house was occupied  have we ever heard of a dust mite <unk> darren dust mite and his family moved in <unk> as you can see <unk> bart simpson is having a little argument <unk>  <unk> they 're arguing about the space on the pin there 's not enough room for the two of them <unk> so i didn 't think he was going to throw bart off i think he was just warning him actually but this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt what i did i plucked the tag out and put it underneath the microscope i used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end <unk> what i did is the same process where i just kind of hold my breath and just work away very very slowly manipulating the plastic  cutting it because it behaves different whenever you work on that level things behave different because it 's on this molecular level things change and they act different and sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air and <unk> different things happen <unk> but i had to make a little barrier going around it out of cellophane to stop stop it moving then static electricity set in <unk> and it went <unk>  and i 'm trying to remove it and the static is interfering with everything so there is sweat dripping off my head because i have to carve homer simpson like <unk> and after i 've cut out the shape then i have to make sure that there is room for bart 's neck  so after i 've done the same thing then i have to paint it <unk> and after i 've actually sculpted them <unk> i have to paint them <unk> i experimented with a i found a dead fly and i plucked the hair off the fly 's head decided to make a paintbrush <unk> even though they get on our nerves i would never kill an insect because <unk> all creatures great and small there is a hymn that says that so what i decided to do is to pluck fine hair out of my face <unk> and i looked at it underneath the microscope that was the paintbrush <unk>  and whilst i 'm painting i have to be very careful because the paint starts to to turn into little blobs and it starts to dry very quickly <unk> so i have to be very quick <unk> if i 'm not it will end up looking not like what it 's supposed to look like it could end up looking like humpty dumpty or somebody else <unk> so i have to be very very careful  this one took me approximately <unk> i would say <unk> six to seven weeks  <unk> rough estimate sometimes five six to seven weeks you can 't always anticipate  as you can see <unk> that 's charlton heston brought down to size <unk> i enjoyed your film that 's why as you can see there 's an aphid fly there that 's just to show the scale and the actual size of the sculpture <unk> i would say it probably measures a quarter of a millimeter in america they say a period stop <unk> so say if you cut a period stop in half a full stop that 's about the size of the whole thing it 's made the chariot is made of gold and charlton heston is made of a floating fiber which i took out of the air <unk> when the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers <unk> and what i normally do is walk ' round a room <unk> to find one  and then i put it underneath the microscope <unk> i remember one time i was doing it and the window was open <unk>  and there was a lady standing by the bus stop and she saw me walking around like this and then she looked at me <unk> and then i went <unk> to actually do this thing the actual chariot is made of gold <unk> i had a 24 karat gold ring and i cut off a little flake of gold and i bent it ' round and made it into the chariot  and the horse is made from nylon and the spider 's web is for the reins on the horse to get the symmetrical shape of the horse was very difficult <unk>  because i had to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was in some kind of action <unk> i did this one a gentleman seen it and said to me  there 's no way you can do this you must have used some kind of machine there 's no way a man can do that it must be a machine  so i says ok then if you say it 's a machine <unk> most famous statue in the world this one <unk> <unk> i would <unk> to put the torch on the top <unk> that one is more or less the same type of process the bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand <unk> because i wanted to get a bit of the stone effect i used a microscopic shard of diamond to actually carve the actual base <unk>  well i can look at this one and i can be very proud of this <unk> because that statue has always sort of kept an image in my head of you know the beginning of people coming to america so it 's sort of ellis island and seeing america for the first time <unk> and that 's the first thing they saw so i wanted to have that little image <unk> and this is it  and we all know that is the hulk i wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle because we know we see needles but people aren 't familiar with the eye of a needle apart from putting a thread through it <unk> so i broke the needle <unk> and made a needle look like the hulk 's broken it it 's i had to make little holes in the base of the needle to shove his feet in so most of my work i don 't use glue they go in with their own friction <unk>  and that 's how i managed to do it <unk> as you can see he 's looking at the moment he 's got a little grimace on his face and <unk> mouth must be probably about three microns so the eyes are probably about one micron or something <unk>  that ship there that 's made from 24 karat gold <unk> and i normally rig it with the web of a money spider <unk>  but i had to rig it with strands of glue <unk> because the web of the spider <unk> it was sending me insane because i couldn 't get the web to move off and <unk> that <unk> 's 24 karat gold and it 's constructed i built it <unk> constructed each plank of gold <unk> and the whole thing is sort of symmetrical the flag had to be made out of little strands of gold <unk> it 's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right <unk> it 's something i wanted to do just to show how i could get the symmetrical shape the actual rigging on the reins on the horse are made from the same sort of thing and that was done with a particle from <unk> green around there by scraping the particles off a green shirt and then pressed onto the needle it 's very painstaking work <unk> but the best things come in small packages
