 <unk> i became the world chess champion after beating anatoly karpov earlier that <unk> i played what is called simultaneous exhibition against of the world 's best chess playing machines in hamburg germany <unk> i won all the games and then it was not considered much of a surprise that i could beat thirty two computers at the same time  to me that was the golden age  machines were weak and my hair was strong just twelve years later <unk> i was fighting for my life against just one computer in a match called by the cover of newsweek the brain 's last stand no pressure  from mythology to science fiction human versus machine has been often portrayed as a matter of life and death  john henry called the steel driving man in the 19th century african american folk legend was pitted in a race against hammer bashing a tunnel through mountain rock john henry 's legend <unk> is a part of a long historical narrative pitting humanity versus technology <unk>  and this competitive rhetoric is standard now we are in a race against the machines  in a fight or even in a war <unk>  jobs are being killed off people are being replaced as if they had vanished from the earth it 's enough to think <unk> there are very few instances of an arena where the human body and mind can compete on equal terms with a computer or a robot actually i wish there were a few more <unk>  instead <unk> it was my blessing and my curse to literally become the proverbial man in the man versus machine competition that everybody is still talking about  in the most famous <unk> competition since john henry <unk> i played two matches against the ibm supercomputer <unk> nobody remembers that i won the first match  in philadelphia before losing the rematch the following year in new york  but i guess that 's fair  there is no day in history <unk> special calendar entry for all the people who failed to climb mt everest before sir edmund hillary and tenzing norgay made it to the top  i was still the world champion when chess computers finally came of age <unk> i was mt everest and deep blue reached the summit <unk> <unk> hats off to them <unk>  as always machine 's triumph was a human triumph <unk> something we tend to forget when humans are surpassed by our own creations  deep blue was victorious but was it intelligent no no it wasn 't at least not in the way alan turing and other founders of computer science had hoped  it turned out that chess could be crunched by brute force <unk> once hardware got fast enough and <unk> deep blue was intelligent <unk>  but even at the incredible speed two hundred million positions per second  deep blue 's method provided <unk> into the mysteries of human intelligence <unk>  soon  machines will be taxi drivers and doctors and professors <unk> but will they be intelligent  i would rather leave these definitions to the philosophers and to the <unk> really matters is how we humans feel about living and working with these machines when i first met deep blue in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six in february <unk> i had been the world champion for more than ten years <unk>  and i had played one hundred <unk> world championship games and hundreds of games against other top players in other competitions i knew what to expect from my opponents and what to expect from myself <unk> i was used to measure their moves and to gauge their emotional state by watching their body language <unk> and then i sat across the chessboard from deep blue <unk>  i immediately sensed something new <unk> something unsettling  you might experience a similar feeling the first time you ride in a driverless car or the first time your new computer manager issues an order at work <unk> but when i sat at that first game i couldn 't be sure what is this thing capable of  technology can advance in leaps <unk> and ibm had invested heavily <unk> i lost that game <unk>  and i couldn 't help <unk> might it be invincible was my beloved game of chess over  these were human doubts human fears and the only thing i knew for sure was that my opponent deep blue had no such worries at all  i fought back after this devastating blow to win the first match <unk> but the writing was on the wall i eventually lost to the machine but i didn 't suffer the fate of john henry who won but died with his hammer in his hand  it turned out that the world of chess still wanted to have a human chess champion  and even today when <unk> a free chess app on the latest mobile phone is stronger than deep blue <unk> people are still playing chess even more than ever before  doomsayers predicted that nobody would touch the game that could be conquered by the machine and they were wrong <unk> proven wrong <unk>  but doomsaying has always been a popular pastime when it comes to technology i learned from my own experience is that we must face our fears if we want to get the most out of our technology <unk> and we must conquer those fears if we want to get the best out of our <unk> of inspiration from my battles against deep blue as the old russian saying goes if you can 't beat them join them <unk>  then i thought  what if i could play with a computer together with a computer at my side <unk> combining our strengths  human intuition plus machine 's calculation human strategy <unk> tactics <unk> human experience machine 's memory could it be the perfect game ever played my idea came to life in <unk> <unk> the name of advanced chess when i played <unk> this human plus machine competition against another elite player <unk> but in this first experiment <unk> we both failed to combine human and machine skills effectively  advanced chess found its home on the internet <unk>  and in two thousand and five <unk> a so called freestyle chess tournament produced a revelation a team of grandmasters and top machines participated <unk> but the winners were not grandmasters not a supercomputer <unk>  the winners were a pair of amateur american chess players operating three ordinary pcs at the same time  their skill of coaching their machines effectively counteracted counteracted the superior chess knowledge of their grandmaster opponents and much greater <unk> computational power of others <unk>  and i reached this formulation  a weak human player plus a machine plus a better process is superior to a very powerful machine alone <unk> but more remarkably is superior to a strong human player plus machine and an inferior <unk> process  this convinced me that we would need better interfaces to help us coach our machines towards more useful intelligence <unk>  human plus machine isn 't the future it 's the present <unk> everybody that 's used online translation to get the gist of a news article from a foreign newspaper <unk> knowing its far from perfect  then we use our human experience to make sense out of that and then the machine learns from our corrections  this model is spreading and investing in medical diagnosis security analysis  the machine crunches <unk> eighty percent of the way ninety percent <unk> making it easier for analysis and decision making of the human party but you are not going to send your kids to school in a self driving car with ninety percent accuracy <unk> even with <unk> so we need a leap forward to add a few more crucial decimal places <unk>  twenty years after my match with deep blue <unk> second match this sensational the brain 's last stand  headline has become commonplace as <unk> machines move in every sector <unk> seemingly every day <unk>  but unlike in the past when machines replaced farm animals <unk> manual labor now they are coming after people with college degrees and political influence and as someone who fought machines and lost i am here to tell you this is excellent <unk> excellent news  eventually every profession will have to feel these pressures or else it will mean humanity has ceased to make progress we don 't get to choose when and where technological progress stops <unk> we cannot slow down in fact <unk> we have to speed up  our technology excels at removing difficulties and uncertainties from our lives <unk>  and so we must seek out <unk> ever more difficult ever more uncertain challenges  machines have calculations <unk> we have understanding machines have instructions <unk> <unk> should not worry about what our machines can do today <unk> instead <unk> we should worry about what they still cannot do today <unk> because we will need the help <unk> intelligent machines to turn our grandest dreams into reality <unk> and if we fail <unk> if we fail <unk> it 's not because our machines are too intelligent or not intelligent enough if we fail it 's because we grew complacent and limited our ambitions our humanity is not defined by any skill  like swinging a hammer or <unk> even playing chess there 's one thing only a human can do that 's dream <unk> so let us dream big
