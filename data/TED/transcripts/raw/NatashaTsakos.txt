 <unk> love theater i love the idea that you can transform become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective  i love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen the idea that in <unk> that room at that moment <unk> everyone <unk>  regardless of their age their gender their race their color their religion <unk> comes together at that moment we transcend space and time together  theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination  and our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers our ability to imagine makes us <unk> inventors and creators and unique <unk>  i was commissioned in two thousand and three to create an original show <unk> and began developing upwake  upwake tells the story of zero a modern day business man going to work with his life in a suitcase  stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two  i wanted upwake to have the same audiovisual qualities <unk> as a movie would <unk> and i wanted to let my imagination run wild so i began drawing the story that was moving in my head <unk>  if antoine de <unk> <unk> saint exupery the author of the little prince were here he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you was inside  because if you look closely enough things will begin to appear  this is not a box these are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life  in upwake buildings wear suits <unk> zero tap dances on a giant keyboard <unk> clones himself with a scanner tames and whips the computer mice <unk> sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space <unk> i wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist go from one world to another in a second  i wanted to have humor <unk> beauty <unk> simplicity and complexity and use metaphors to suggest ideas at the beginning of the show for example zero deejays dream and reality technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition  <unk> on stage so today i would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology let 's start with technology  all right let 's start with theater <unk> all <unk> all the four surfaces of the stage which i interact with  the use of animation and projection was a process of discovery i didn 't use it as a special effect but as a partner on stage <unk>  there are no special effects in upwake no artifice it 's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal three hundred and forty four frames four and a half years and commissions later <unk>  what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists <unk> and here are some excerpts <unk> moon <unk> new show that we 're now beginning to tour and in austin texas <unk> i was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon when i arrived at one of the schools i certainly did not expect this <unk> six hundred kids packed in a gymnasium waiting <unk> i was a little nervous performing without animation costume really and make up  but the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn 't seen the kids that attentive and i think the reason why is that i was able to use their language and their reality in order to transport them into another something happened along the way zero became a person <unk> not just a character in a play zero does not speak  is neither man nor woman zero is zero a little hero of the 21st century <unk>  and zero can touch so many more people than i possibly could <unk>  it 's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box  as a street performer <unk> i have learned that everybody wants to connect and that usually <unk> if you 're a bit extraordinary <unk> you 're not exactly of human appearance then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud <unk>  it 's as though you made something resonate within them it 's as though the mystery of the person they 're interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more <unk> because through your mask they let theirs go being <unk> is an art form i know theater can improve the quality of people 's lives and i know theater can heal i 've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years i have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy <unk> i know theater unites us  zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow tell various stories through different <unk> quantum physics video games <unk> and zero wants to go to the moon in two thousand and seven zero launched a green campaign suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity every sunday from seven <unk> fifty three to eight zero p m the idea is simple basic it 's not original  but it 's important <unk> and it 's important to participate <unk> there is a revolution <unk> it 's a human and technological revolution <unk> it 's <unk> and emotion it 's information  it 's visual <unk> it 's musical <unk> it 's sensorial <unk> it 's conceptual it 's universal it 's beyond words and numbers <unk> it 's happening  the natural progression of science and art finding each other to better touch and define the human experience <unk>  there is a revolution in the way that we think in the way that we share and the way that we express our stories  our evolution  this is a time of <unk> communication <unk> connection and creative collaboration
