and decide not to do it i 'm not quite sure why you decide not to do it <unk> you 're too lazy to do it it 's too hard <unk> you 're afraid if you look for your passion and don 't find <unk> <unk> it you 'll feel like you 're an idiot so then you make excuses about why you 're not going to look for your passion they are excuses ladies and gentlemen we 're going to go through a whole long list your creativity <unk> <unk> in thinking of excuses not to do what you really need to do if you want to have <unk> for example one of your great excuses is  well great careers are really and truly for most people just a matter of luck <unk> so i 'm going to stand around i 'm going to try to be lucky <unk>  <unk> and if i 'm lucky i 'll have a great career if not i 'll have a good career but a good career is an impossibility so that 's not going to work then <unk> your other excuse is yes <unk> there are special people who pursue their their passions <unk> but they are geniuses they are steven <unk> j i 'm not a genius <unk> <unk> when i was five i thought i was a genius but my professors have beaten that idea out of my head long since <unk> fifty being completely competent that would have given you a great career but guess what this is almost two thousand and twelve <unk> and saying to the world i am totally completely competent  is damning yourself with the faintest of praise <unk> and then of course another excuse <unk> i would do this <unk> i would do this but but well after all <unk>  i 'm not weird <unk> everybody knows that people who pursue their passions are somewhat obsessive a little strange hmm hmm  okay you know a fine line between madness and genius i 'm not weird <unk> <unk> i 've read steven j ' s biography oh my goodness i 'm not that <unk> but i still want a great career <unk> i 'm not prepared to pursue my passion <unk> so i know what i 'm going to do <unk> because i have i have a solution i have a strategy <unk> it 's the one mommy and daddy told me about mommy and daddy told me that if i worked i worked hard i 'd have a good career <unk>  so if you work hard and have a good career <unk> if you work really really really hard <unk> you 'll have

really really hard <unk> you know what you 'll succeed the world will give you the opportunity to work really <unk> you so sure that that 's going to give you a great career <unk> when all the evidence is to the contrary so <unk> let 's deal with those of you who are trying to find your passion you actually understand that you really had better do it <unk> never mind the excuses you 're trying to find your passion  <unk> you found something you 're interested in i have an interest <unk> i have an interest you tell me <unk> you say i have an interest i say that 's wonderful <unk>  and what what are you trying to tell me well i have an interest i say do you have passion i have an interest you say  your interest is compared to what well <unk> i 'm interested in this  and what about the rest of humanity 's <unk> is your greatest love passion is the thing that will help you create the highest expression of your talent passion <unk> interest it 's not the same thing are you really going to go to your sweetie and say marry me <unk>  <unk> what you want what you want what you want  is passion it is beyond interest  you need twenty interests <unk> and then one of them one of them might grab you one of them might engage you more than anything else <unk> and then you may have found your greatest love in comparison to all the other things that interest and that 's what passion is i have a friend <unk> proposed to his sweetie he was an economically rational person <unk> he said to his sweetie let us marry <unk>  let us merge our interests  laughter yes he did i love you <unk> i love you deeply <unk>  i love you more than any other woman i 've ever encountered <unk>  i love you more than mary <unk> jane susie penelope ingrid gertrude <unk> gretel i was on a german exchange program then <unk> i love you more than  all right she left the room halfway through his enumeration of his love for her <unk> after he got over his surprise at being know turned down he concluded he 'd had a narrow escape from marrying an irrational person although he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed it was perhaps not necessary to enumerate all of the women he had auditioned for the part <unk> but the point stands you must look for alternatives so that you find your destiny <unk> or are you afraid of the word <unk> the word destiny scare you that 's what we 're talking about and if you don 't find the highest expression of your talent <unk> if you settle for interesting what the hell ever that means do you know what will happen at the end of your long life your friends and family will be <unk> gathered in the cemetery and there beside your gravesite will be a tombstone and inscribed on that tombstone it will say here lies a distinguished engineer who invented velcro  but what that tombstone should have said in an alternative lifetime what it should have said if it was your highest <unk> here lies the last nobel laureate in physics who formulated the grand unified field theory and demonstrated the practicality of warp drive  laughter velcro indeed  one was a great career <unk> one was a missed opportunity <unk> but then there are some of you <unk> in spite of all these excuses you will find you will find your passion  and you 'll still fail <unk> you 're going to fail <unk> because because you 're not going to do it <unk> because you will have invented a new excuse any excuse to fail to take action and this <unk> excuse i 've heard so many times yes <unk> i would pursue a great career <unk> but i value human relationships more than accomplishment <unk> i want to be a great friend <unk> i want to be a <unk> i want to be a great parent <unk> and i will not sacrifice them on the altar of great accomplishment  what do you want me to say now <unk> do you really want me to say now tell you really i swear i don 't kick children  look at the worldview you 've given yourself you 're a hero no matter what <unk> and i by suggesting ever so delicately that you might want a great career <unk> must hate children i don 't hate children i don 't kick them <unk> yes there was a little kid wandering through this building when i came here and no i didn 't kick him  laughter course i had to tell him the building was for adults only and to get out  he mumbled something about his mother <unk> and i told him she 'd probably find him outside anyway last time i saw him he was on the stairs crying  what a wimp but what do you mean that 's what you expect me to say <unk> do you really think it 's appropriate that you should actually take children and use them as a shield <unk> you know what will happen someday <unk> ideal parent you  the kid will come to you someday and say  i know what i want to be  i know what i 'm going to do with my life you are so happy it 's the conversation a parent wants to hear <unk> because your kid 's good in math <unk> and you know you 're going to like what comes next  says your kid i have

think about that again kid you 're so good at math why don 't you the kid interrupts you and says but it is my dream it <unk> is my dream to do this and what are you going to say <unk> you know what you 're going to say look kid <unk> i had a dream once too but but so how are you going to finish the sentence with your but but  i had a dream too once kid <unk> but i was afraid to pursue it or are

something you could have said to your kid <unk> when he or she said i have a dream you could have said looked the kid in the face and said  go for it kid <unk>  just like i did  but you won 't be able to say that  because you didn 't so you can 't  and so the sins of the parents <unk> are visited on the poor children  why will you seek refuge in human relationships as your excuse not to find and pursue your passion <unk> you know why in your heart of hearts <unk> you know why and i 'm being deadly serious <unk> you know why you would get all warm and fuzzy and wrap yourself up in human relationships it is because you are you know what you are you 're afraid to pursue your passion <unk>  you 're afraid to look ridiculous you 're afraid to try <unk> you 're afraid you may fail <unk>  great friend great spouse <unk> great parent  great career is that not a package is that not who you are how can you be one without the other <unk>  but you 're afraid  and that 's why you 're not going to have a great career <unk> is also attached to that other most terrifying phrase if only i had <unk> your brain it will hurt a lot so those are the many reasons why you are going to fail to
