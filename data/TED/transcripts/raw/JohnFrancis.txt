 <unk> i <unk> thank you for being here and i say thank you for being here because i was silent for seventeen years and the first words that i spoke were in <unk> of earth day and my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak <unk> and i said <unk> thank you for being here my mother out in the audience she jumped up hallelujah johnnys talking  imagine if you were quiet for seventeen years and your your mother was out in the audience say <unk> my <unk> i turned around because i didnt recognize where my voice was coming from  i hadnt heard my voice in seventeen years so i turned around and i looked and i said god who 's saying what im thinking  and then i realized it was me you know <unk> and i kind of laughed <unk> and i could see my father take you on this journey and the journey i believe is a metaphor for all of our journeys <unk> <unk> even though this one is kind of unusual i want you to think about your own journey <unk> my journey began in <unk> when i witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the golden <unk> gate and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay  it disturbed me so much that i decided that i was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles thats a big thing in california <unk> and it was a big thing in my little community of point reyes station in inverness california <unk> because there were only about three hundred and fifty people there in the winter this was back in ' seventy one now  and so when i came in and i i started walking around  people they just knew what was going on and people would drive up next to me and say john what are you doing <unk> bad right youre walking to make us feel bad and maybe there was some truth to that because i thought that if i started walking everyone would follow because of the oil everybody talked about the polllution <unk> and so i argued with people about that i argued and i argued i called my <unk> ive given up riding and driving in cars my dad said why didnt you do that when you were sixteen  i didnt know about the environment then theyre back in philadelphia <unk> and so i told my mother im happy though im really happy she said if you were happy son you wouldnt have to say it mothers are like that  and so on my my 27th birthday i decided because i argued so much and i talk so much that i was going to stop speaking for just one day one day to give it a rest <unk>  and so i did <unk> i got up in the morning and i didnt say a word <unk> and i have to tell you it was a very moving experience because for the first time <unk> and what i heard  it kind of disturbed me because what i used to do when i thought i was listening was i would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that i could i knew what they were going to say <unk> and so i stopped listening <unk> and in my mind i just kind of raced ahead and thought of what i was going to say back while they were still finishing up <unk> and then i would <unk> launch in well <unk> that just ended communication <unk>  so on this first day i actually listened and it was very sad for me because i realized that for those many years i had not been learning i <unk> <unk> was twenty seven i thought i knew everything  <unk> and so i decided id better do this for another day <unk>  and another day <unk> and another day until finally i promised myself for a year i would keep quiet because i started learning more and more and i needed to learn more so for <unk> <unk> a year i said i would keep quiet and then on my birthday i would reassess what i had learned and maybe i would talk again well that lasted seventeen years  now during that time those seventeen years i walked and i i played the banjo and i painted and i wrote in my journal and i tried to study the environment by reading books and i decided that i was going to go to school <unk>  so i did i walked up to ashland oregon where they were offering an environmental studies degree its only five hundred miles and i went into the registrars office and what what  what i had a newspaper clipping oh  so you really want to go to school here you dont we have a special program for you they did <unk> and in those two years i graduated with my first degree a bachelors degree and my father came out he was so proud he said listen were really proud of you son <unk>  but what are you going to do with a bachelors degree <unk> you dont ride in cars you dont talk youre going to have to do those things  i hunched my shoulder i picked my backpack up again and i started walking  i walked <unk> all the way up to port townsend washington <unk> where i built a wooden boat <unk> rode it across puget sound <unk> and walked across washington [ to ] idaho and down to missoula montana <unk> i had written the university of montana two years earlier and said i 'd like to go to school there i said i 'd be there in <unk> and i was there i showed up in two years and they i tell this story because they really helped me there are two stories in montana the first story is i didnt have any money thats a sign i used a lot <unk> and they said don 't worry about that the director of the program said come back tomorrow he gave me one hundred and fifty dollars <unk> and he said register for one one credit <unk> youre going to go to south america said rivers and lakes the hydrological systems south america <unk>  so i did that he came back he said to me ok john now that you 've registered for that one credit <unk> you can have a key to an office you can matriculate youre matriculating so you can use the library <unk> and what were going to do is were going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class <unk> theyre going to save your grade <unk>  and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money then you can register for that class and theyll give you the grade wow  they dont do that in graduate schools i dont think but i use that story because they really wanted to help me <unk> they saw that i was <unk> they really wanted to help me along the way and during that time i actually taught classes without speaking i had thirteen students when i first walked into the class i explained with a friend who could interpret my sign language that i was john francis i was walking around the world i didnt talk and this was the last time this persons going to be here interpreting for me <unk>  all the students sat around and they <unk> i could see they were looking for the schedule to see when they could get out  they had to take that class with me two weeks later everyone was trying to get into our class and i learned in that class because i would do things like this <unk> i think hes talking about selective forestry now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion  i just backed out of that you know and i just kind of kept the fists from flying <unk> but what i learned was that sometimes i would make a sign and they said things that i absolutely did not mean but i should have <unk>  and so what what came to me is if you were a teacher and you were teaching <unk> if you werent learning you probably werent teaching very well <unk>  and so i went on my dad came out to see me graduate and you know i did the deal and my father said were really proud of you son but you know what went on he said youve got to start riding and driving and start talking what are you going to do <unk> a masters degree i hunched my shoulder i got my backpack and i went on to the university of wisconsin <unk> i spent two years there writing on oil spills <unk> no one was interested in oil spills <unk> but something happened exxon valdez <unk> and i was the only one in the united states writing on oil spills <unk> my dad came out <unk> again he said i don 't know how you do this son i mean you <unk> don 't ride in cars you dont talk my sister said maybe i should leave you alone because you seem to be doing a lot better when youre not saying anything  well <unk> i put on my backpack again <unk>  i put my banjo on and i walked all the way to the east coast put my foot in the atlantic ocean it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across <unk> united states and on earth day one thousand nine hundred and ninety the 20th anniversary of earth day thats when i began to speak <unk> and thats why i said thank you for being here because it 's sort of like that tree in the forest falling and if there 's no one there to hear does it really make a sound and im thanking you and i 'm thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak <unk> communication and they also taught me about listening that they listened to me and its one of those things that came out of the silence the listening to each other  really very important we need to listen to each other well <unk> my journey kept going on my dad said <unk> let that go i worked for the coastguard was made a u n goodwill ambassador <unk> i wrote regulations for the united states i mean i wrote oil spill regulations <unk> twenty years ago if someone had said to me john do you really want to make a difference  yeah i want to make a difference he said you just start walking east get out of your car and just start walking east and as i walked off a little bit <unk> they 'd say yeah and shut up too  youre going to make a difference buddy  how could that be how could that be how could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference <unk> well <unk> my time at the coast guard was a really good time and after that i only worked one year i said that 's enough <unk> one year 's enough for me to do that i got on a sailboat and i sailed down to the caribbean and walked through all of the islands and to venezuela and you know i forgot the the most important thing which is why i started talking <unk> which i have to tell you  i started talking because i had studied environment id studied environment at this formal level <unk> but there was this informal level <unk> and the informal level i learned about people and what we do and how we are and environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other <unk> because if we are the environment then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other <unk>  and so thats the message that i had and i said well i 'm going to have to spread that message and i got in my sailboat sailed all the way through the caribbean it wasn 't really my sailboat <unk> kind of worked on that boat got to venezuela and i started walking  this is the last part of this story because its how i got here because i still didn 't ride in motorized vehicles <unk>  i was walking through el dorado it 's a prison town famous prison or infamous prison in venezuela  and i dont know what possessed me because this was not like me <unk>  there i am walking past the guard <unk> gate and the guard stops and says  pasaporte <unk> pasaporte  and with an m16 pointed at me and i looked at him and i said <unk> <unk> passport huh  i don 't need to show you my passport its in the back of my pack <unk> i 'm dr francis i 'm a u n ambassador and i 'm walking around the world  and i started walking off what possessed me to say this the road turned into the jungle <unk> i didnt get shot <unk>  and i got to i start saying free at last thank god almighty <unk> im free at last  what was that about <unk> what was that about it took me one hundred miles to figure out that in my heart in me <unk> i had become a prisoner i was a prisoner and i needed to escape the prison that i was in was the fact that i did not drive or use motorized vehicles <unk> now how could that be <unk> because when i started it seemed very appropriate to <unk> me not to use motorized vehicles <unk> but the thing that was different was that every birthday i asked myself about silence <unk> but i never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet  i had no idea i was going to become a u n ambassador i had no idea i would <unk> and so i realized that i had a responsibility to more than just me <unk>  and that i was going to have to change <unk> you know we can do it  i was going to have to change <unk> and i was afraid to change because i was so used to the guy who only just walked  i was so used to that person that i didnt want to stop i didnt know who i would be if i <unk> changed <unk>  but i know i needed to  i know i needed to change because it would be the only way that i could be here today <unk>  and i know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where <unk> weve gotten to but theres another place for us to go and we kind of have to leave behind <unk> the security of who weve become and go to the place of who we are becoming <unk>  and so i want to encourage you to go to that next place to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in as comfortable as it may be <unk> because we have to do something now we have to change now  as our former vice president said <unk> we have to become activists <unk>  so if my voice can touch <unk> you if my actions can touch you if my being here can touch you please let it be <unk> and i know that all of you have touched me while ive been here  so lets go out into the world and take this caring this love this respect that weve shown each other <unk> here at ted and take this out into the world because we are the environment and how we treat each other is really how were going to treat the environment so i want to thank you for being here and i want to end this in five seconds of
