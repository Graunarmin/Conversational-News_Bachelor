 <unk> our ancestors looked up at the night sky and wondered what stars are wondering therefore how to explain what they saw in terms of things unseen okay so most people only wondered that occasionally like today <unk> in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them <unk> what normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know they wished they knew how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing <unk> and how they could rest when they were tired without risking starvation be warmer <unk> cooler <unk> safer <unk>  <unk> i bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better <unk> in every aspect of their lives <unk> they wished for progress just as we do but they failed  almost completely  to make any  they didn 't know how to discoveries like <unk> fire happened so rarely that from an individual 's point of view  the world never improved nothing new was learned the first clue to the origin of starlight happened as recently as <unk> physicists discovered the whole explanation <unk> expressed as usual in elegant symbols <unk>  but never mind the symbols <unk> think how many discoveries they represent <unk> nuclei and nuclear reactions of course <unk> the conversion of mass to energy that 's e = mc ^ two gamma rays transmutation <unk>  that ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists was achieved through these same theories <unk> that explained starlight and other ancient mysteries <unk> and new <unk> unexpected phenomena <unk> that all that  discovered in forty years had not been in the previous hundred thousand was not for lack of thinking about stars and all those other urgent problems they had they even arrived <unk> at answers such as myths that dominated their lives <unk> yet bore almost no resemblance to the truth <unk> the tragedy of that protracted stagnation isn 't sufficiently recognized i think these were people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did <unk> discover all those things <unk> but that ability to make progress remained almost unused <unk> until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe <unk> or so we should hope because that event was the scientific revolution ever since which our <unk> knowledge of the physical world and of how to adapt it to our wishes  has been growing relentlessly  now what had changed what were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stagnation and rapid open ended discovery how to make that difference is surely the most important <unk> universal truth that it is possible to know <unk>  worryingly there is no consensus about what it is so i 'll tell you  but i 'll have to backtrack a little first  before the scientific revolution  they believed that everything important knowable was already known enshrined in ancient writings <unk> institutions <unk> and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb which were however <unk>  entrenched as dogmas <unk> along with many falsehoods <unk>  so they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little  and therefore progress depended on learning how to reject the authority of <unk> learned men priests traditions and rulers which is why the scientific revolution had to have a wider context the enlightenment  a revolution in how people sought knowledge trying not to rely on <unk> take no one 's word for it but that can 't be what made the difference authorities had been rejected before many times and that rarely if ever caused anything like the scientific revolution <unk> at the time what they thought distinguished science <unk> we 've seen that that can 't be true it did help by promoting observation and experiment but from the outset it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it  knowledge comes from the senses <unk> in what language <unk> certainly not the language of mathematics in which galileo rightly said <unk> the book of nature is written <unk> look at the world you don 't see equations carved on to the mountainsides if you did it would be because people had carved them  by the way why don 't we do that what 's wrong with us  empiricism is inadequate because well scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen <unk> the unseen <unk> you have to admit doesn 't come to us through the senses we don 't see those nuclear reactions in stars we don 't see the origin of species <unk> we don 't see the curvature of space time and other universes <unk> but we know about those things  <unk> the classic empiricist answer is induction the unseen resembles the seen but it doesn 't you know what the clinching evidence was that <unk> is curved  it was a photograph not of space time but of an eclipse with a dot there rather than there and the evidence for evolution some rocks and some finches <unk> and parallel universes <unk> again dots there rather than there on a screen what we see in all these cases <unk>  bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects <unk> so you admit it 's all interpretation no one has ever seen evolution we see rocks you have your interpretation we have ours yours comes from guesswork <unk> ours from the bible but what creationist and empiricists both ignore is that in that sense <unk> no one has ever seen a bible either that the eye only <unk> light <unk> which we don 't perceive brains only detect nerve impulses <unk>  and they don 't perceive even those as what they really are <unk> namely electrical crackles so we perceive nothing as what it really is our connection to reality is never just perception <unk> scientific knowledge isn 't derived from anything it 's like all knowledge it 's conjectural guesswork <unk>  tested by observation not derived from it  so were testable conjectures the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates testability is common <unk> in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking any crank claiming the sun will go out next tuesday has got a testable prediction <unk>  consider the ancient greek myth explaining seasons <unk>  <unk> god of the underworld kidnaps persephone the goddess of spring and negotiates a forced marriage contract requiring her to return regularly and lets her go and each year <unk>  she is magically compelled to return and her mother demeter goddess of the earth  is sad <unk>  and makes it cold and barren <unk> is caused by demeter 's sadness <unk> then it must happen everywhere on earth simultaneously  so if the ancient greeks had only known that australia is at its warmest when demeter is at her saddest  they 'd have known that their theory is false  so what was wrong with that <unk> that momentous difference i think there is one thing you have to care about and that implies testability the scientific method the enlightenment and everything and here is the crucial thing  there is such a thing as a defect in a story i don 't just mean a logical defect i mean a bad explanation what does that mean <unk> well explanation is an assertion about what 's there unseen <unk> that accounts for what 's seen because the explanatory role of persephone 's marriage contract could be played equally well by infinitely many other ad hoc entities <unk> why a marriage contract and not any other reason for regular annual <unk> action here is one persephone wasn 't released she escaped <unk> and returns every spring to take revenge on hades with her spring powers <unk> she cools his domain with spring air <unk> venting heat up to the surface creating <unk> accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth it 's equally testable <unk> yet what it asserts about reality is in many ways the opposite and that is possible because the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons <unk> except via the myth itself <unk>  this easy <unk> the sign of a bad explanation <unk> because without a functional reason to prefer one of countless variants <unk>  advocating one of them in preference to the others is irrational  so for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress <unk> seek <unk> the ones that can 't be easily varied while still explaining the phenomena now our current explanation of seasons is that the earth 's axis is tilted like that  so each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year <unk> and away for the other half  better put that up  that 's a good explanation <unk> hard to vary because every detail plays a functional role for instance we know independently of seasons that surfaces tilted away from radiant heat are heated less and that a spinning sphere <unk> in space points in a constant direction <unk> and the tilt also explains the sun 's angle of elevation at different times of year and <unk> predicts that the seasons will be out of phase in the two hemispheres if they 'd been observed in phase  the theory would have been refuted <unk> but now <unk>  the fact that it 's also a good explanation <unk> hard to vary makes the crucial difference  if the ancient greeks had found found out about seasons in australia they could have easily varied their myth to predict that  for instance when demeter is upset she banishes heat from her vicinity <unk> into the other hemisphere where it makes summer <unk>  being proved wrong by observation and changing their theory accordingly still wouldn 't have got the ancient greeks one jot closer to understanding <unk> because their explanation was bad easy to vary <unk> and it 's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it 's testable if the axis tilt <unk> theory had been refuted <unk> its defenders would have had nowhere to go no easily implemented change could make that tilt cause the same seasons in both hemispheres <unk>  <unk> the basic regulating principle of the enlightenment <unk> so <unk> in science two false approaches blight progress one is well known <unk> untestable theories  but the more important one is explanationless theories whenever you 're told that some existing statistical trend will continue <unk> what causes that trend you 're being told a wizard did it <unk> hard to vary
