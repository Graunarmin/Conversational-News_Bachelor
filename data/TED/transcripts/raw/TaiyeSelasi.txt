 <unk> i went on my first book tour <unk>  in thirteen months i flew to fourteen countries and gave some hundred talks every talk in every country <unk> comes from england and the states whenever i heard this opening sentence no matter the country that concluded it england america ghana nigeria i thought but that 's not <unk> i was born in england and grew up in the united states <unk>  my mum born in england and raised in nigeria <unk> currently lives in ghana <unk>  my father was born in gold coast a british colony raised in ghana  and has lived for over thirty years in the kingdom of saudi arabia for this reason my <unk> also called me <unk> i went to louisiana a museum in denmark where i shared the stage with the writer colum mccann  we were discussing the role of locality in writing when suddenly it hit me <unk> i 'm not <unk> i 'm not a national at all how could i come from a nation <unk> how can a human being come from a concept  it 's a question that had been bothering me for going on two decades  from newspapers textbooks conversations  i had learned to speak of countries as if they were eternal singular naturally occurring things  but i wondered to say that i came from <unk> that the country was an absolute some fixed point in place in time a constant thing but was it <unk>  in my lifetime countries had disappeared czechoslovakia <unk>  appeared timor leste failed somalia my parents came from countries that didn 't exist when they were born  to me a country this thing that could be <unk> born die expand <unk> contract hardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being and so it came as a huge relief to discover the sovereign state <unk> what we call countries are actually various expressions of sovereign statehood an idea that came into fashion only four hundred <unk> when i learned this beginning my masters degree in international relations  i felt a sort of surge of relief it was as i had suspected history was real <unk>  cultures were real but countries were invented  for the next ten years i sought to re or un define myself my world my work my experience <unk> beyond the logic of the state <unk>  in two thousand and five i wrote an essay <unk> is an afropolitan sketching out an identity that privileged culture over country it was thrilling how many people could relate to my experience <unk> and instructional how many others didn 't buy my sense of self  how can selasi claim to come from <unk> when she 's never known the indignities of traveling abroad on a ghanian passport now if i 'm honest <unk> i knew just what she meant <unk>  i 've got a friend named layla who was born and raised in ghana <unk> her parents are <unk> of lebanese descent <unk> layla who speaks fluent twi knows accra like the back of her <unk> when we first met years ago <unk> i thought she 's not from ghana  in my mind she came from lebanon <unk> despite the patent fact that all her formative experience took place in suburban accra  i like my critics was imagining some ghana where all ghanaians had brown skin or none held u k passports <unk> fallen into the limiting trap that the language of coming from countries sets the privileging of a fiction the singular country  over reality  human experience <unk>  speaking with colum mccann that day <unk> the penny finally dropped <unk> i have no relationship with the united states <unk> all fifty of them <unk> not really <unk>  my relationship is with brookline the town where i grew up <unk> with new york city where i started work with lawrenceville <unk> where i spend thanksgiving <unk>  what makes america home for me is not my passport or accent <unk>  but these very particular experiences and the places they occur <unk>  despite my pride in ewe culture the black stars and my love of ghanaian food <unk>  i 've never had a relationship with the republic of ghana <unk> writ large <unk>  my relationship is with <unk> where my mother lives where i go each year with the little garden in <unk> dzorwulu where my father and i talk for hours  these are the places that shape my experience <unk> my experience is where i 'm from <unk>  what if we asked <unk> instead of where are you from where are you a local  this would tell us so much more about who and how similar we are tell me you 're from france and i see what a set of adichie 's dangerous single story the myth of the nation of france <unk>  tell me you 're a local of fez and paris better yet goutte d 'or  and i see a set of experiences our experience is where we 're from <unk>  so where are you a local i propose a <unk> three step test <unk> think of your daily rituals whatever they may be making your coffee driving to work harvesting your crops saying your prayers <unk>  what kind of rituals are these where do they occur <unk> in what city or cities in the world do shopkeepers know your face  as a child i carried out fairly standard suburban rituals in boston with adjustments made <unk> for the rituals my mother brought from london and lagos  we took off our shoes in the house we were unfailingly polite with our elders we ate slow cooked spicy food  in snowy north america <unk> ours were rituals of the global south <unk>  the first time i went to delhi or to southern parts of italy i was shocked by how at home i felt the rituals were familiar number one rituals  now <unk> think of your relationships of the people who shape your days <unk>  to whom do you speak at least once a week be it face to face or on facetime be reasonable in your assessment i 'm not talking about your facebook friends  i 'm speaking of the people who shape your weekly emotional <unk> my mother in accra <unk> my twin sister in boston <unk> my best friends in new york these relationships are home for me r  number two relationships we 're local where we carry out our rituals and relationships <unk> but how we experience our locality depends in part on our restrictions by restrictions i mean where are you able to live what passport do you hold are you restricted by say racism from <unk> fully at home where you live  by civil war dysfunctional governance economic inflation from living in the locality where you had your rituals as a child <unk>  this is the least sexy of the rs less lyric than rituals and relationships <unk> but the question takes us past where are you now <unk> take a piece of paper and put those three words on top of three columns  then try to fill those columns as honestly as you can  a very different picture of your life in local context of your identity as a set of experiences <unk> may emerge so let 's try it <unk>  i have a friend named olu he 's thirty five years old his <unk> parents born in nigeria came to germany on scholarships olu was born in nuremberg and lived there until age ten when his family moved to lagos he studied in london <unk> then came to berlin <unk>  he loves going to nigeria the weather the food the friends but hates the political corruption there <unk> where is olu from <unk> i have another friend named udo he 's also <unk> old <unk> udo was born in crdoba in northwest argentina where his grandparents migrated from germany what is now poland <unk> after the war  udo studied in buenos aires and nine years ago came to berlin <unk>  he loves going to argentina the weather the food the friends but hates the economic corruption there <unk>  where is udo from with his blonde hair and blue eyes udo could pass for german <unk> but holds an argentinian passport so needs a visa to live in berlin <unk> that udo is from argentina has largely to do with history that he 's a local of buenos aires and berlin that has to do with life  olu who looks nigerian needs a visa to visit nigeria  he speaks yoruba with an english accent and english with a german one to claim that he 's not really nigerian though denies his experience in lagos the rituals he practiced growing up his relationship with family and friends  meanwhile <unk> though lagos is undoubtedly one of his homes olu always feels restricted there  not least by the fact that he 's gay <unk>  both he and udo are restricted by the political conditions of their parents ' countries from living where some of their most meaningful <unk> rituals and relationships occur <unk>  to say olu is from nigeria and udo is from argentina distracts from their common experience their rituals their relationships and their restrictions are the same  of course when we ask where are you from we 're using a kind of shorthand it 's quicker to say nigeria than  <unk> as with google maps we can always zoom in closer from country to city to neighborhood <unk> but that 's not quite the point  the difference between where are you from  and where are you a local isn 't the specificity of the answer it 's the intention of the question <unk>  replacing the language of nationality with the language of locality asks us to shift our focus to where real life occurs even that most glorious expression of countryhood the world cup  gives us national teams comprised mostly of multilocal players  as a unit of measurement for human experience <unk> the country doesn 't quite work <unk>  that 's why olu says i 'm german but my parents come from nigeria <unk> in that sentence belies the inflexibility of the units one fixed and fictional entity bumping up against another  i 'm a local of lagos and berlin suggests overlapping experiences <unk> layers that merge together that can 't be denied or removed  you can take away my passport but you can 't take away my experience <unk> that i carry within me where i 'm from comes wherever i go  to be clear <unk> i 'm not suggesting that we do away with countries there 's much to be said for national history more for the sovereign state  culture exists in community and community exists in context geography tradition collective memory these things are important <unk>  what i 'm questioning is primacy all of those introductions on tour began with reference to nation as if knowing what country <unk> i came from would tell my audience who i was  what are we really seeking though when we ask where someone comes from and what are we really seeing when we hear an answer  here 's one possibility <unk> basically countries represent power where are you from <unk> it 's possible that without realizing it we 're playing a power game especially in the context of multi ethnic countries as any recent immigrant knows the question <unk> where are you from or where are you really from is often code for why are you <unk> then we have the scholar william <unk> <unk> deresiewicz 's writing of elite american colleges  students think that their environment is diverse if one comes from missouri and another from pakistan never mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers i 'm with him to call one student american another pakistani then triumphantly claim student body diversity ignores the fact that these students are locals of the same milieu <unk>  the same holds true on the <unk> other end of the economic spectrum  a mexican gardener in los angeles and a nepali housekeeper in delhi have more in common in terms of rituals and restrictions than nationality <unk> <unk> implies <unk> perhaps my biggest problem with coming from countries is the myth of going back to them <unk>  <unk> to ghana <unk> it 's not because i wasn 't born there <unk> my father can 't go back either the country in which he was born that country no longer exists  we can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it something somewhere will always have changed most of all ourselves  people  <unk> talking about is human experience this notoriously and gloriously disorderly affair  in creative writing locality bespeaks humanity <unk> the more we know about where a story is set the more local color and texture <unk> the more human the characters start <unk> <unk> to feel <unk> the more relatable not less the myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from <unk> all of us are multi multi <unk> to begin our conversations with an acknowledgement of this complexity brings us closer together i think not further apart so the next time that i 'm introduced <unk> i 'd love to hear the truth <unk> a human being like everybody here she isn 't a citizen of the world but a citizen of worlds she is a local of new york rome and accra
