 <unk> god gave the white man a watch and gave the black man time  i think how is it possible for a man with so much time to tell his story in eighteen minutes be quite a challenge for me  most african stories these days <unk> they talk about famine hiv and aids poverty or war but my story that i would like to share with you today is the one about success  it is about a country in the southwest of africa called namibia namibia has got two point one million people <unk> but it is only twice the size of california <unk> i come from a region in the remote northwest part of the country it 's called kunene region  and in the center of kunene region is the village of sesfontein this is where i was born this is where i 'm coming from <unk> most people that are following the story of angelina jolie and brad pitt will know where namibia is  they love namibia for its beautiful dunes  that are even taller than the empire state building <unk>  wind and time have twisted our landscape into very <unk> and these shapes are speckled with wildlife that has become so adapted to this harsh and strange land  i 'm a himba you might wonder why are you wearing these western clothes i 'm a himba and namibian a himba is one of the twenty nine ethnic groups in namibia <unk> we live a very traditional lifestyle <unk> i grew up herding looking after our livestock goats sheep and cattle <unk>  and one day my father actually took me into the bush he said john <unk> i want you to become a good herder <unk> boy <unk> if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat <unk> and he will let go of the goat and run off  but then he said boy <unk> if you run into a lion <unk> don 't move <unk> don 't move <unk> stand your <unk> imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after in this way in this way i actually started to learn about nature <unk> in addition to being an ordinary namibian and in addition to being a himba i 'm also a trained conservationist  and it is very important if you are in the field to know what to confront <unk> the whites could farm <unk> graze and hunt as they wished <unk> but we black we were not regarded as responsible to to use wildlife <unk> whenever we tried to hunt <unk>  we were called poachers <unk> and as a result we were fined and <unk> and soviet interests fought for control over my country <unk>  and you know during war time <unk> there are militaries <unk> armies that are moving around <unk> and the army hunted for valuable rhino horns and tusks <unk> they could sell these things for anything between <unk> every himba had a rifle because it was wartime <unk> the british <unk> 303 rifle was just all over the whole country <unk>  then in the same time around one thousand nine hundred and eighty we had a very big drought <unk> it killed almost everything that was left  our livestock was was <unk> i remember a night when a hungry leopard went into the house of one of our neighbors and took a sleeping child out of the bed it 's a very sad story but even today that memory is still in people 's minds they can pinpoint the exact location where <unk> almost lost everything and my father said  why don 't you just go to school and they sent me off to school just to get busy somewhere there  and the year i went to school my father actually got a job with a non governmental organization called irdnc integrated rural development and nature conservation <unk>  they actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities they were trusted by the local communities like our leader joshua kangombe <unk> joshua kangombe saw what was happening wildlife disappearing <unk> poaching was skyrocketing <unk> and the situation seemed very hopeless <unk> death and despair surrounded joshua and and our entire communities <unk>  <unk> proposed to joshua what if we pay people that you trust to look after wildlife <unk> do you have anybody in your communities <unk> or people that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well my father has been a poacher for quite a long time <unk> instead of shooting poachers dead like they were doing elsewhere in africa irdnc has helped helped men reclaim their abilities to manage their peoples and their rights to own and <unk> people started feeling ownership over wildlife wildlife numbers started coming back and that 's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in namibia  with independence the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by our new government  three things that actually help to build on this foundation the very first one is honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas <unk>  here is our tradition at every himba village <unk> there is a sacred fire <unk>  and at this sacred fire <unk> the spirit of our ancestors speak through the headman and advise us where to get water where to get grazings <unk> and where to go and hunt <unk>  and i think this is the best way of regulating ourselves on the environment <unk> and here are the new ideas <unk>  transporting rhinos using helicopters i think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can 't see isn 't it  and these things we were taught by outsiders <unk> we learned these things from outsiders we needed new boundaries to describe our <unk> we needed to learn more things like gps just to see whether can gps really reflect the true reflection of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere in the west <unk> and we we then wanted to see whether we can match our ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world  and through this we actually started realizing our dreams <unk> and we maintained honoring our <unk> traditions but we were still open to new ideas <unk>  the second element is that we wanted to have a life a better life where we can benefit through many things most poachers  like my father  were people from our own community they were not people from outside these were our own people  and sometimes once they were caught <unk> they were treated with respect  <unk> back into the communities and they were made part of the bigger dreams <unk> the best one like my father i 'm not campaigning for my father  laughter they were put in charge to stop others from from poaching <unk>  and when this thing started going on we started becoming one community renewing our connection to nature <unk> and that was a very <unk> in namibia <unk>  the last element that actually helped develop these things was the partnerships <unk> our government has given legal status over our traditional lands <unk>  the other partners that we have got is business communities <unk>  business communities helped bring namibia onto the world map and they have also helped make <unk> wildlife a very valuable land use like any other land uses such as agriculture <unk>  and most of my conservation colleagues today that you find in namibia have been trained through the initiative through the involvement of world wildlife fund in the most <unk> up to date conservation practices they have also given funding for two decades to this whole program and so far with the support of world wildlife fund we 've been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today <unk>  namibia <unk> or sesfontein was no more an isolated village somewhere hidden away in namibia <unk> with these assets we are now part of the global village <unk>  thirty years have passed since <unk> father 's first job as a community game guard it 's very unfortunate that he passed away and he cannot see the success as i and my children see it today <unk> when i finished school in <unk> <unk> were only twenty lions in the entire northwest in our area <unk> but today <unk> there are more than one hundred and thirty lions so please if you go to namibia make sure that you stay in the tents <unk> don 't walk out at night  the black rhino they were almost extinct in <unk> they are now in big numbers but they are now far away from our village <unk> because the natural plain has multiplied  like zebras <unk> springboks and everything they stay very much far away <unk> this other thing has multiplied from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals what started as very small community rangers getting community involved  has now grown into something that we call conservancies conservancies are legally instituted institutions by the government <unk> and these are run by the communities themselves for their benefit today we have got sixty conservancies that manage and protect over thirteen million hectares of land in namibia <unk>  we have already reshaped conservation in the <unk> conservancy generated five point seven million dollars this is our new economy an economy based on the respect of our natural resources <unk> and we are able to use this money for many things very importantly we put it in education <unk>  secondly <unk> we put it for infrastructure <unk> food very important <unk> you know that africa is being affected by these viruses <unk>  and this is the good news from africa that we have to shout from the rooftops  and now what <unk> to help me and our partners take some of what we have learned in namibia to other places with similar problems places like mongolia  or even in your own backyards <unk> the northern great plains where buffalo and other animals have suffered and many communities are in decline <unk> i like that one  namibia serving as a model to africa  and africa serving as a model to the united states  we were successful in namibia <unk> because we dreamed of a future that was much more than just a healthy wildlife <unk> we knew conservation would fail if <unk> to improve the lives of the local communities  so  come and talk to me about namibia <unk> and better yet <unk> come to namibia and see for yourself how we have done it and please <unk> do visit our website to learn more and see how you can help cbnrm in africa and across the world <unk> thank you very much
