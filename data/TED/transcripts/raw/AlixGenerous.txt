 <unk> i want to talk to you about dreams <unk> i have been a lucid dreamer my whole life <unk> and it 's cooler than in the movies  laughter beyond flying breathing fire and making hot men spontaneously appear i can do things like read and write music  fun fact is that i wrote my personal statement to college in a dream <unk>  and i did accepted so yeah i am a very visual thinker  i think in pictures not words to me <unk> words are more like instincts and language there are many people like me <unk> nikola tesla for <unk> example <unk> who could visualize <unk> design test and troubleshoot everything all of his inventions in his mind <unk> accurately  language is kind of exclusive to our species anyway <unk> i am a bit more primitive like a beta version of google translate <unk> my brain has the ability to hyper focus on things that interest me  for example once i had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages  there are some other unusual things about me <unk>  you may have noticed that i don 't have much inflection in my voice that 's why people often confuse me with a gps this can make basic communication a challenge unless you need directions a few years ago when i started doing <unk> i went to get head shots done for the first time the photographer told me to look flirty and i had no idea what she was talking about  she said do that thing you know with your eyes when you 're flirting with guys <unk> searching for waldo  there 's a reason for this as there is a reason that waldo is hiding  laughter i have asperger 's  <unk> form of autism that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display it 's made life difficult in many ways and growing up  i struggled to fit in socially my friends would tell jokes <unk> but i didn 't understand them  my personal heroes were george carlin and stephen colbert and they <unk> my personality switched from being shy and awkward to being defiant and cursing out a storm  needless to say i did not have many friends i was also hypersensitive to texture  the feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles <unk> and so for years i refused to shower <unk> i can assure you that my hygiene <unk> i had to do a lot to get here <unk> and my parents things kind of got out of control when i was sexually assaulted by a peer and on top of everything it made a difficult situation worse <unk> and i had to travel two thousand miles across the country to get <unk> but within days of them prescribing a new medication my life turned into an episode of the walking dead <unk>  i became paranoid and began to hallucinate that rotting corpses were coming towards me  my family finally rescued me <unk> but by that time <unk> i had lost nineteen pounds in those three weeks as well as developing severe anemia <unk> and was on the verge of suicide <unk> treatment center that understood my aversions my trauma <unk> and my social anxiety <unk>  and they knew how to treat it and i got the help i finally needed <unk> and after eighteen months of hard work <unk>  i went on to do incredible things  one of the things with asperger 's is that <unk> these people have a very complex inner life and i know for myself i have a very colorful personality rich ideas <unk> and just a lot going on in my mind but there 's a gap between where that stands and how i communicate it with the rest of the world and this can make basic communication a challenge <unk>  not many places would hire me due to my lack of social skills which is why i applied to waffle <unk> where you can order your hash browns the many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse <unk> as social norms would have it you should only go to waffle house at an ungodly hour in the night  so one time at two am i was chatting with a waitress <unk> and i asked her what 's the most ridiculous thing that 's happened to you on the job  and she told me that one time a man walked in completely naked  laughter i said great sign me up for the graveyard shift <unk> needless to say waffle house did not hire me so in terms of having asperger 's it can be viewed as a disadvantage and sometimes it is a real pain in the butt <unk>  but it 's also the opposite it 's a gift <unk> and it allows me to think innovatively  at nineteen i won a research competition for my research on coral <unk> reefs <unk> and i ended up speaking at the un convention of biological diversity presenting this research <unk> but consider what i had to do to get here twenty five therapists <unk> eleven misdiagnoses and years of pain and trauma <unk>  i spent a lot of time thinking if there 's a better way <unk> and i think there <unk> <unk> technology this technology could play an integral role in helping people with autistic spectrum disorder or asd  the app podium <unk> released by my company <unk> <unk> has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills in addition to this it tracks eye contact through camera and simulates <unk> one of the great things is that i 've used podium to help me prepare for today <unk> and it 's been a great help but it 's more than that there 's more that can be done <unk> for people with asd it has been speculated that many innovative scientists  researchers artists <unk> and engineers have it  like for example <unk> emily dickinson jane austen isaac newton and bill gates are some examples <unk> but the problem 's encountered is that these brilliant ideas often can 't be shared if there are communication roadblocks <unk> and so many people with autism are being overlooked every day and they 're being taken advantage of so my dream for people with autism is to change that to remove the roadblocks that prevent them from <unk> one of the reasons i love lucid dreaming is because it allows me to be free  without judgment of social and physical consequences  when i 'm flying over scenes that i create in my mind i am at peace <unk>  i am free from judgment <unk> and so i can do whatever i want you know i 'm making out with brad pitt and angelina is <unk> is bigger than that and more important <unk> my goal is to shift people 's perspective of autism and people with <unk> asperger 's because there is a lot they can do i mean look at temple grandin <unk> and by doing so <unk> we allow people to share their talents with this world and move this world forward in addition we give them the courage to pursue their dreams in the real world in real time <unk> thank you
