 <unk> i have a confession  i have been in an affair since i was seventeen years old <unk> i wish i could talk about butterflies <unk> in my stomach or maps i drew on the ground when i think about this affair <unk> but i cannot <unk>  i wish i could talk about sweet words spoken or gifts that i received from this affair <unk>  but i cannot <unk>  all i can tell you about is the aftermath about days i spent constantly <unk> i remember how it all began i was in my final year of high school and my class had just won in sports so we were singing and dancing and hugging each other <unk> i went and took a shower <unk> then i went for dinner <unk>  and when i sat down to eat my teeth started chattering <unk> so i couldn 't put the spoon in my mouth i rushed to the nurse 's office and because i couldn 't talk i just pointed at my mouth <unk> she didn 't know what was happening so she told me to lie down <unk>  and it worked after a few minutes the chattering stopped <unk> i was about to dash out and she told <unk> she insisted that i go up to the dormitories to sleep  here i was in my final year of high school  just a few months from doing my end of high school exams and a few days from doing a set of exams we call here in kenya mocks which are <unk> <unk> somehow meant to gauge how prepared one is for the final exams there <unk> class sat down took my kenyan history notes and there i was down kenyan coastal town with the great <unk> was marking imaginary papers in and out it went  and with every stroke one by one my classmates stopped concentrating on their reading and started looking at me <unk>  and i tried really hard to stop it but i couldn 't because it had a life of its own <unk>  and then when it was <unk> sure everybody was looking at us  in its final show and official introduction i had my first full blown seizure <unk> which was the beginning of what has been affair  seizures are the trademark characteristic for most types of epilepsy and every every first ever seizure needs to be assessed by a doctor to determine if one has epilepsy or if it 's a symptom of something else  in my case  it was confirmed that i had epilepsy  i spent a large chunk of my time in hospital and at home <unk> and only went back to do my final exams i had seizures in between <unk> papers <unk> but managed to get good enough grades to be admitted for an actuarial science degree at the university of nairobi  unfortunately <unk> i had to drop out in my second year <unk>  i didn 't have good enough coping skills and a support community around me <unk>  i was lucky <unk> enough to get a job <unk> but i was fired from that job when i had a seizure in the workplace so i found myself in a space where i was constantly asking myself why this had to happen to me <unk> i lived in denial <unk> denial was maybe because of the things that had happened <unk> dropping out of school and being fired from my job  or maybe it was because of the things i had heard about epilepsy and about people living with epilepsy  that they would never live on their own that they would never travel on their own or or even get work <unk> that they were outcasts with a spirit in them that they needed to be delivered from <unk>  and so the more i thought about these things  the more my seizures became became <unk>  and i spent days with my legs locked my speech became blurred and on days on end this is <unk> how i 'd be two or three days after a seizure my head and my hand would still be twitching <unk>  i felt lost <unk> i had so much frustration in me <unk> and so i started writing because the people around me didn 't have answers to the questions that i had and so i wrote my fears and my doubts <unk> i wrote about my good days and my bad days and my really ugly days <unk> and i shared them on a blog <unk>  and before long  i began to be seen and heard by people who had epilepsy and their families <unk> and even those who did not have the diagnosis <unk>  and i moved from that girl who constantly asked why me to one who not only <unk> but does it for those who are yet to find their voices <unk> my seizures are greatly reduced from two to three times a day to sometimes two to three times in one year <unk>  <unk> on to employ five people when i began what was kenya 's first free mental health and epilepsy support line <unk>  and i travel  and i travel to speak about my affair <unk>  all these things that i had been told people like me living with epilepsy could never be able to do  every year a population <unk> population as big as eighty percent of nairobi gets diagnosed with epilepsy across the globe <unk> and they like me <unk> go through the emotions of stigma and exclusion <unk> and so i have made it my life journey to keep these <unk> and i keep confessing about my affair so that those people who do not have the diagnosis might know and might have a constant reminder that it is alright to engage with people like us that as long as they pull down the walls of stigma and exclusion <unk>  that we just like them can be able to take anything life throws at us <unk> thank you
