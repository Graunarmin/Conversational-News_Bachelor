 <unk> i 'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey <unk> extraordinarily rewarding journey actually <unk> which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis <unk> as a child <unk> i had two passions one was a passion for rodents <unk>  i had all kinds of rats <unk> mice <unk> hamsters  gerbils squirrels you name it i bred it and i sold them to pet shops  laughter i also had a passion for africa growing up in a multicultural environment <unk> we had african students in the house and i learned <unk> about their stories <unk>  so different backgrounds <unk>  dependency on imported <unk> know how goods <unk> services <unk> exuberant cultural diversity  africa was truly fascinating for me i became an industrial engineer engineer in product development <unk> and i focused on appropriate detection <unk> appropriate technologies for developing countries i started working in the industry <unk> but i wasn 't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear <unk> extracting and manufacturing mode i quit my job to focus on the real world problem landmines <unk>  we 're talking ' <unk> princess diana is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier to any development <unk> which is really true as long as these devices are there or there is suspicion of landmines you can 't really enter into the land <unk> actually there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they 're needed to produce which is mainly in the developing world <unk> we chose rats why would you choose rats <unk> vermin <unk> well actually rats are in contrary to what most people think about them rats are highly sociable creatures and actually <unk> our product what you see here there 's a target somewhere here  you see an operator a trained african with his rats in front who actually are left and right <unk> there the animal finds a mine it scratches on the soil and the animal comes back <unk> for a food reward <unk> very very simple very sustainable in this environment  here the animal gets its food reward <unk> and that 's how it works <unk> very very simple  now why would you use rats rats have been used since the ' 50s last century in all kinds of <unk> more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species  they 're extremely sensitive to smell <unk> moreover they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it  now how do we communicate with rats well <unk> don 't talk rat <unk> but we have a clicker a standard method for animal training which you see there with which you can reinforce particular behaviors first of all we associate the click sound with a food reward which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe  once the animal knows click food click food click food so click is food we bring it in a cage with a hole <unk> and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed and to do that for five seconds five seconds <unk> which is long for a rat once the animal knows this we make the task a bit more difficult <unk>  it learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes up to ten holes <unk>  then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets in the next step <unk> animals learn to find real mines in real minefields <unk> and accredited according to international mine action standards just like dogs have to pass a test this consists of four hundred square meters there 's <unk> a number of mines placed blindly and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all <unk> if the animal does that it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field just like dogs by the way <unk> maybe one slight difference we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog  this is our team in mozambique one tanzanian trainer  who transfers the skills to these three mozambican fellows and you should see the pride in the eyes of these people  they have a skill <unk> which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid <unk> moreover this small team together with of course you need the heavy vehicles and the manual <unk> de miners to follow up but with this small investment in a rat capacity <unk> we have demonstrated in mozambique that we can reduce the <unk> per square meter up to sixty percent of what is currently normal two dollars per square meter we do it at $ one point one eight and we can still bring that price down question of scale if you can bring in more rats <unk> we can actually make the output even bigger <unk> we have a demonstration site in mozambique <unk>  eleven african governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology <unk> they have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the great lakes region and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines <unk>  but let me bring you to a very different problem and there 's about six thousand people last year that walked on a landmine  but worldwide last year almost one point nine million died from tuberculosis as a <unk> reaches from forty to sixty percent reliability in tanzania the numbers don 't lie forty five percent of people <unk> it means that if you have t b  you have more chance that you won 't be detected but will just die from t b secondary infections and so on and if however <unk> you are detected very early diagnosed early treatment can start and even in <unk> to the smell of tar already the old chinese and the greek <unk> hippocrates have actually <unk> can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients  so what we did is we collected some samples just as a way of testing from hospitals <unk> trained rats on them and see see if this works <unk> and wonder well <unk> we can reach eighty nine percent sensitivity eighty six percent specificity using multiple rats in a row this is how it works <unk> and really this is a generic technology we 're talking now explosives tuberculosis but can you imagine you can actually put anything under there so how does it work you have a cassette with ten samples you put these ten samples at once in the cage an animal only needs two hundredths of a second <unk> goes extremely fast here it 's already at the third sample this is a positive sample it gets a click sound and comes for the food reward  and by doing so very fast we can have like a second line opinion to see which patients are positive which are negative  <unk> whereas a microscopist can process forty samples in a day a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only  a cage like this  a cage like this provided that you have rats and we have now currently twenty five tuberculosis rats <unk> a cage like this operating throughout the day can process one thousand six hundred and eighty samples  can you imagine the potential offspring applications environmental detection of pollutants in soils <unk> customs applications detection of illicit goods in containers and so on  but let 's stick first to tuberculosis <unk> i just want to briefly highlight the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only the five clinics in dar es salaam on a population of five hundred thousand people where fifteen thousand reported to get a test done  microscopy for one thousand eight hundred patients and by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back  we were able to increase case detection rates by over thirty percent throughout last year we 've been depending on which <unk> intervals you take we 've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between thirty and forty percent  so this is really considerable knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to fifteen people <unk> healthy people per year <unk> you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives at least our hero rats have saved lots of lives <unk> the way forward for us is now to standardize this technology <unk>  and there are simple things like for instance <unk> we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds so to standardize this also to standardize the pellets the food rewards <unk>  and to semi automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people to conclude there are also other applications at the horizon here is a first prototype of our camera rat <unk> which is a rat with a rat backpack <unk> with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on this is in a prototype stage we don 't have a working system here yet  <unk> projects <unk> but in the end it is about people it is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult <unk>  expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks and doing that with a local resource <unk> plenty available  so something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you <unk> whether they are environmental technological animal or human and to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world <unk> thank you very much
