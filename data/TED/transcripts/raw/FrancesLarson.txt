 <unk> for the last year <unk> everyone 's been watching the same show <unk>  and i 'm not talking about game of thrones but a horrifying real life drama that 's proved too fascinating to turn off  it 's a show produced by murderers and shared around the world via <unk> the internet  their names have become familiar james foley steven sotloff david haines <unk> alan henning peter <unk> kenji goto jogo their beheadings by the islamic state were barbaric <unk> but if we think they were archaic from a remote <unk> age then we 're wrong they were uniquely modern <unk>  because the murderers acted knowing well that millions of people would tune in to watch  the headlines called them savages and barbarians <unk>  because the image of one man overpowering another <unk> killing him with a knife to the throat <unk> conforms to our idea of ancient primitive <unk> practices <unk> the polar opposite of our urban civilized ways  we don 't do things like that  but that 's the irony <unk> we think a beheading has nothing to do with us even as we click on the screen to watch <unk> but it is to do with us  the islamic state beheadings are not <unk> ancient or remote they 're a global 21st century event  a <unk> 21st century event that takes place in our living rooms at our desks on our computer screens  they 're entirely dependent on the power of technology to connect us <unk>  and whether we like it or not everyone who watches is a part of the show and <unk> of people watch <unk>  we don 't know exactly how many obviously it 's difficult to calculate <unk> but a poll taken in the uk for example in august <unk> <unk> estimated that one point two million people had watched the beheading of james foley in the few days after it was released <unk> and that 's just the first few days <unk> and just britain  a similar poll taken in the united states in november two thousand and fourteen found that nine percent of those surveyed had watched beheading videos <unk>  and a further twenty three percent had watched the videos but had stopped just before the death was shown <unk> nine percent may be a small minority of all the people who could watch <unk> but it 's still a very large crowd <unk>  and of course that crowd is growing all the time <unk> because every week every month more people will keep downloading and keep watching  if we go back eleven years <unk> before sites like youtube and facebook were born <unk>  it was a similar story when innocent civilians like daniel pearl nick berg paul johnson were beheaded  those videos were shown during the iraq war <unk>  nick berg 's beheading quickly became one of the most searched for items on the internet  within a day <unk> it was the top search term across search engines like google <unk> lycos yahoo in the week after nick berg 's beheading these were the top ten search terms in the united states  the berg beheading video remained the most popular search term for a week <unk> and it was the second most popular search term for the whole month of may <unk> website that first showed nick berg 's beheading had to close down within a couple of days due to overwhelming traffic to the site  one dutch website owner said that his daily viewing figures rose from three hundred thousand to seven hundred and fifty thousand every time a beheading in iraq was shown he told reporters <unk> eighteen months later that it had been downloaded many millions of times <unk> and that 's just one website a similar pattern was seen again and again when videos of beheadings were released during the iraq war <unk>  social media sites have made these images more accessible than ever before <unk> but if we take another step back in history we 'll see that it was the camera that first created a new kind of crowd in our history of beheadings as public spectacle  as soon as the camera appeared on the scene a full lifetime ago on june seventeen <unk> it had an immediate and unequivocal effect that day the first film of a public beheading was created in france <unk> france it was the execution the guillotining of a german serial killer outside the prison saint pierre in versailles <unk> weidmann was due to be executed at the crack of dawn as was customary at the time <unk>  but his executioner was new to the job <unk> and he 'd underestimated how long it would take him to prepare <unk> was executed at four thirty in the morning <unk> by which time on a june morning there was enough light to take photographs  and a spectator in the crowd filmed the event unbeknownst to the authorities  several still photographs were taken as well <unk> and you can still watch the film online today and <unk> look at the photographs the crowd on the day of weidmann 's execution was called unruly and disgusting by the press but that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people who could now study the action over and over again <unk> the camera may have made these scenes more accessible than ever before <unk> but it 's not just about the camera  if we take a bigger leap back in history we 'll see that for as long as there have been public judicial executions and beheadings  there have been the crowds to see them  in london as late as the early <unk> 19th century <unk> there might be four or five thousand people to see a standard hanging <unk> could be forty thousand or fifty thousand to see a famous criminal killed <unk>  and a beheading which was a rare event in england at the time <unk> attracted even more  in may one thousand eight hundred and twenty five men known as the cato street conspirators were executed in <unk> london for plotting to assassinate members of the british government they were hung and then decapitated it was a gruesome scene <unk> each man 's head was hacked off in turn and held up to the crowd  and one hundred thousand people that 's ten thousand more than can fit into wembley stadium  had turned out to watch the streets were packed  <unk> had rented out windows and rooftops  people had climbed onto carts and wagons in the street people climbed lamp posts  people had been known to have died in the crush on popular execution days <unk>  evidence suggests that throughout our history of public beheadings and public executions  the vast majority of the people who come to see are either enthusiastic or at best <unk> disgust has been comparatively rare  and even when people are disgusted and are horrified <unk> it doesn 't always stop them from coming out all the same to watch <unk>  perhaps the most striking example of the human ability to watch a beheading and remain unmoved and even be disappointed was the <unk> introduction in france in <unk> of the guillotine that famous decapitation machine  to us in the <unk> 21st century the guillotine may seem like a monstrous contraption  but to the first crowds who saw it it was actually a disappointment <unk> executions on the scaffold where people were mutilated and burned and pulled apart slowly  to them watching the guillotine in action it was so quick there was nothing to see  the blade fell the head fell into a basket out of sight immediately  and they <unk> give me back my gallows <unk> give me back my wooden gallows  the end of torturous public judicial executions in europe and america was partly to do with being more humane towards the criminal <unk>  but it was also partly because the crowd obstinately refused to behave in the way that they should  all too often execution day was more like a carnival than a solemn ceremony  a public judicial execution in europe or america is unthinkable  but there are other scenarios that should make us cautious about thinking that things are different now and we don 't behave like that anymore  take for example <unk> the incidents of suicide baiting  this is when a crowd gathers to watch a person who has climbed to the top of a public building in order to kill themselves and people in the crowd shout and jeer get on with it go on and jump this is a <unk> phenomenon  one paper in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one found that in ten out of twenty one threatened suicide attempts  there was incidents of suicide baiting and jeering from a <unk> there have been incidents reported in the press this year <unk>  this was a very widely reported incident in telford and shropshire in march this year <unk>  and when it happens today <unk> people take photographs and they take videos on their phones and they post those videos online  when it comes to brutal murderers who post their beheading videos the internet has created a new kind of crowd <unk> the action takes place in a distant time and place <unk>  which gives the viewer a sense of detachment from what 's happening a sense of separation it 's nothing to do with me it 's already happened <unk>  we are also offered an unprecedented sense of intimacy today we are all offered front row seats we can all watch in private in our own time and space <unk> and no one need ever <unk> know that we 've clicked on the screen to watch <unk>  this sense of separation from other people from the event itself seems to be key to understanding our ability to watch <unk> and there are several ways in which the internet creates a sense of detachment that seems to erode individual moral responsibility <unk> our activities online are often contrasted with real life as though the things we do online are somehow less real  we feel less accountable for our actions when we interact online there 's a sense of anonymity a sense of invisibility <unk> so we feel less accountable for our behavior  the internet also makes it far easier to stumble upon things inadvertently things that we would usually <unk> avoid in everyday life  today a video can start playing before you even know what you 're watching  or you may be tempted to look at material that you wouldn 't look at in everyday life or you wouldn 't look at if you were with other people at the time  and when the action is pre recorded and takes place in a distant <unk> time and space watching seems like a passive activity  there 's nothing i can do about it now it 's already happened <unk>  all these things make it easier as an internet user for us to give in to our sense of curiosity about death  to push our personal boundaries  to test our sense of shock to explore our sense of shock <unk> but we 're not passive when we watch on the contrary <unk> the murderer 's desire to be seen when the victim of a decapitation is bound and defenseless he or she essentially becomes a pawn in their killer 's show <unk> unlike a trophy head that 's taken in battle that represents the luck and skill it takes to win a <unk> a beheading is staged when it 's essentially a piece of theater  the power comes from the reception the killer receives as he performs  in other words <unk> watching is very much part of the event  the event no longer takes place in a single location at a certain point in time as it used to and as it may still appear to  now the event is stretched <unk> out in time and place <unk> and everyone who watches plays their part  we should stop watching <unk> but we know we won 't  history tells us we won 't and the killers know it too thank you <unk> 's move here while they install for the next performance i want to ask you the question that probably many here have which is how did you get interested in this topic frances larson  i used to work at a museum called the pitt rivers museum in oxford which was famous for its display of shrunken heads from south america  people used to say oh the shrunken head museum the shrunken head museum <unk> the history of scientific collections of skulls i was working on the cranial collections  and it just struck me as ironic that here were people coming to see this gory primitive savage culture that they were almost fantasizing about and creating without really understanding what they were seeing and all the while these vast i mean hundreds of thousands of skulls in our museums across europe and the states were kind of upholding this enlightenment pursuit of scientific rationality so i wanted to kind of twist it round and say let 's look at us we 're looking through the glass case at these shrunken heads let 's look at our own history and our own cultural fascination with these things
