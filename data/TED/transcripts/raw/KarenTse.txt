 <unk> i walked into a prison in cambodia and i met a 12 year old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel <unk> and as i looked into his eyes i realized that for the hundreds of letters i had written for political prisoners <unk> that i would never have written a letter for him <unk>  because he was not a <unk> 12 year old boy who had done something important for anybody he was not a political prisoner he was a <unk> 12 year old boy who had stolen a bicycle what i also realized at that point was that it was not only cambodia <unk> but of the one hundred and thirteen developing <unk> these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured and what i recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool we often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst <unk> <unk> percent of torture today is not for political prisoners it is for people who are in broken down legal systems <unk> and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation it 's cheaper than having a legal system cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel it is what happens most of the time  i believe today that it is possible for us as a world community if we make a decision to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in <unk> our lifetime <unk>  but it will require three things <unk> first is the training <unk> empowerment and connection of defenders worldwide <unk> the second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel <unk> and the third is commitment <unk> so in the year two thousand <unk> i began to wonder what if we came together could we do something for these ninety three countries <unk>  and i founded international bridges to justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the ninety three countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in <unk> did come from cambodia and at the time i remember first coming to cambodia and there were in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four still less than ten attorneys in the country because the khmer rouge had killed them all and even twenty years later there was only ten lawyers in the country so consequently you 'd walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12 year old boys you 'd meet women and you 'd say why are you here women would say well i 've been here for ten years because my husband committed a crime but they can 't find him <unk> place where there was no rule of law the first group of defenders came together and i still remember  as i was training i said okay what do you do for an investigation  and there was silence in the class and finally one woman stood up [ inaudible name ] and she said khrew which means teacher  she said i have defended more than a hundred <unk> i 've never had to do any investigation because they all come with confessions  and we talked about as a class the fact that number one <unk> the confessions might not be reliable <unk>  but number two we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this <unk> especially as it was now against the law <unk>  and it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws <unk> and i still remember the first cases where they <unk> came all twenty five together she would stand up and they were in the back <unk> and they would support her <unk> and the judges kept saying no no no no we 're going to do things the exact same way we 've been doing them but one day the perfect case came and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller she was sitting outside of a house  she said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was but the police came they got her there was nothing on her she was pregnant at the time she had cigarette burns on her she 'd miscarried <unk>  and when they brought her case to the judge for the first time he stood up and he said yes there 's no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released and the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see they have step by step began to change the course of history in cambodia <unk> cambodia is not alone i used to think well is it cambodia <unk> or is it other countries <unk>  but it is in so many countries in burundi i walked into a prison and it wasn 't a <unk> diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison and when i walked up to the prison director i said you 've got to let her out  a judge would let her out and he said okay <unk> we can talk about it but look at my prison <unk>  eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer what can we do so lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can <unk> take cases <unk> but we realized that it 's not only the training of the lawyers <unk> but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference for example in cambodia <unk>  it was that [ inaudible name ] did not go alone but she had twenty four lawyers with her who stood up together and in the same way in china they always tell me it 's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together <unk> in zimbabwe where i remember innocent <unk>  after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said i 've been here for one year eight years twelve years without a lawyer he came and we had a training together and he said i have heard it said because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling i have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not <unk> and then he said but i want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice  and with that he successfully organized <unk> sixty eight lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases <unk> the key that we see though is training and then early access i was recently in egypt and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers <unk> and what they told me is that they said hey <unk> we don 't have police on the streets now the police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution they were torturing everybody all the time and i said but there 's been tens of millions of dollars <unk> that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here what 's going on i met with one of the development agencies <unk>  and they were training prosecutors and judges which is the normal <unk> as opposed to defenders <unk>  and they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual i said i 'm gonna copy this it had everything in it  lawyers can come at the police station it was perfect prosecutors were perfectly trained  but i said to them i just have one question <unk> which is by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor 's office what had happened to them  and after a pause they said they had been tortured  so the pieces are not only the training of the lawyers but us finding a way to <unk> systematically implement early access to counsel because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured and as i tell you this i 'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like oh okay it sounds like we could do it but can we really do it because it sounds big <unk>  and there are many reasons why i believe it 's possible the first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment it 's not only innocent who i told you about in in zimbabwe <unk>  but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces we have a program called justicemakers <unk>  and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things <unk> but how can we support them <unk>  so it 's an online contest where it 's only five thousand dollars if you come <unk> up with and innovative way of implementing justice and there are thirty justicemakers throughout the world from sri lanka to swaziland to the drc  who with five thousand dollars do amazing things through sms programs through paralegal programs <unk> through whatever they can do <unk> and it 's not <unk> but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward <unk>  so in china for instance great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished <unk> and i was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers  and said how can we get this out <unk> how can we make sure that this is implemented this is fantastic and he said to me you have money and i said  and he said that 's okay <unk> we can still figure it out  and on december four <unk> he organized three thousand members of the youth communist league from fourteen of the top law schools  who organized themselves <unk> developed posters with the new laws <unk> and went to the police stations and began what <unk> legal revolution to protect citizen rights  so i talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders we need to systematically implement early access to counsel <unk> but the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this <unk>  and people often say to me you know this is great <unk> but it 's wildly idealistic never going to happen  and the reason that i think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were <unk> used for people who decided they would end slavery  or end apartheid <unk> it began with a small group of people who decided they would commit  now there 's one of our favorite poems from the defenders <unk> which they share from each other is take courage friends <unk> the road is often long the path is never clear <unk>  and the stakes are very high <unk>  but deep down you are not alone  and i believe that if we can come together <unk> as a world community to support not only defenders but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it we can end torture as an investigative tool  i end always because i 'm sure the questions are and i 'd be happy to talk to you at any point but what can i really do well i would say this first of all you know what you can do <unk>  but second of all i would leave you with the story of vishna who actually was my inspiration <unk> for starting international bridges to justice  vishna was a 4 year old boy when i met him who was born in a cambodian prison in kandal province <unk>  but because he was born in the prison  everybody loved him <unk> including the guards <unk> so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars so you know there 's bars <unk> and by the <unk> vishna was getting bigger <unk> which means what gets bigger your head gets bigger <unk>  so he would come to the first bar <unk> the second bar and then the third bar and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through <unk> and come back third second first and he would grab my pinkie <unk>  because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit you know he never quite made it to all of them every day <unk> but he wanted to visit all one hundred and fifty six prisoners <unk>  and i would lift him and he would put his fingers through <unk> or if they were dark cells it was like iron corrugated and he would put his fingers through <unk> and most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine and they looked forward to him <unk> and i was like here 's vishna he 's a 4 year old boy he was born in a prison with almost nothing no material goods <unk> but he had a sense of his own heroic journey which i believe we are all born into  he said probably i can 't do everything <unk> but i 'm one i can do something and i will do the one thing that i can do so i thank you for having the prophetic <unk> imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together and invite you into this journey with us
