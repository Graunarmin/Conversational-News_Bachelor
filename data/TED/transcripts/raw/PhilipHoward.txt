 <unk> i 've always been interested in the relationship of formal structures and human behavior <unk> if you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town people will move there well law is also a powerful driver of human behavior <unk> and what i 'd like to discuss <unk> today is the need to overhaul and simplify the law to release the energy and passion of americans so that we can begin to address the challenges of our society <unk>  you might have noticed that law has grown progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two if you run a business it 's hard to do much of anything without calling your general counsel is this phenomenon now where the general counsels are becoming the ceos it 's a little bit like the invasion of the body snatchers <unk> you need a lawyer to run the company because there 's so much law <unk> but it 's not just business that 's affected by this it 's actually pressed down into the daily activities of ordinary people a couple of years ago i was hiking <unk> it was in a grizzly bear preserve although no one told me that before we went and our guide was a local science teacher she was wholly unconcerned about the bears <unk>  but she was terrified of lawyers the stories started pouring out she 'd just been involved in an episode where a parent had threatened to sue sue the school because she lowered the grade of the student by ten percent when he turned the paper in late  the principal didn 't want to stand up to the parent because he didn 't want to get dragged into some <unk> legal proceedings so she had to go to meeting after meeting same arguments made over and over again <unk> after thirty days of sleepless nights she finally capitulated and raised the grade <unk> she said life 's too short i just can 't keep keep going with this about the same time she was going to take two students to a leadership conference in laramie which is a couple of hours away and she was going to drive them in <unk> you can 't drive them in the car for liability reasons you have to go in a school bus so they provided a bus that held sixty people and drove the three of them back and forth several hours to laramie <unk> her husband is also a science teacher and he takes his biology class on a on a hike in the nearby national park <unk>  but he was told he couldn 't go on the hike this year because one of the students in the class was disabled so the other <unk> get to go on the hike either at the end of this day i could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher  now we 've been taught to believe that law is the foundation of freedom <unk>  but somehow or another in the last couple of decades the land of the free has become become a legal minefield <unk> it 's really changed our lives in ways that are sort of imperceptible <unk> yet when you pull back you see it all the time it 's changed the way we talk i was talking to a pediatrician friend in north carolina he said well you know i don 't deal with patients the same way anymore <unk> you wouldn 't want to say something off the cuff that might be used against you  this is a doctor whose life is caring for people <unk> my own law firm has a list of questions that i 'm not allowed to ask when when interviewing candidates <unk>  such as the sinister question <unk> bulging with hidden motives and innuendo where are you from  now for twenty years tort reformers have been sounding the alarm that lawsuits are out of control <unk> and we read every once in while about these crazy lawsuits like the guy in the district of columbia who sued his dry cleaners for <unk> million dollars because they lost his pair of pants the case went on for two years i think he 's still appealing the case <unk>  but the reality is these crazy cases are relatively rare they don 't usually win <unk>  and the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent which is twice as much as in other countries but  <unk> but the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg what 's happened here again almost without our knowing is our culture has changed people no longer feel free to act on their best judgment <unk>  so what do we do about it we certainly don 't want to give up the rights when people do something wrong to seek redress in the courts we need regulation to make sure people don 't pollute and such <unk> we lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem <unk>  and that 's because we have the wrong frame of reference <unk>  we 've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute every issue is a matter of kind of individual rights and so we peer through a legal microscope <unk>  and look at everything is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances that explain why johnny turned his paper in late in cody wyoming <unk> is it possible that the doctor might have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker <unk> and of course the hindsight bias is perfect there 's always a different scenario that you <unk> <unk> can sketch out where it 's possible that something could have been done differently <unk> and yet we 've been trained to squint into this legal microscope <unk>  <unk> agree what 's fair <unk> and where accidents will be extinct risk will be no more of course this is utopia it 's a formula for paralysis not freedom <unk> it 's not the basis of the rule of law it 's not the basis of a free society <unk>  so now i have the first of four propositions i 'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law <unk> you 've got to judge law <unk> by its effect on the broader society not individual disputes  absolutely vital <unk>  so let 's pull back from the anecdotes for a second and look at our society from high above is it working what does the macro data show us well the healthcare system has been transformed  a culture pervaded with defensiveness <unk> universal distrust of the system of justice <unk>  universal practice of defensive medicine <unk> it 's very hard to measure because there are mixed motives doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes and also they no longer even know what 's right or right or wrong <unk> but reliable estimates range between sixty billion and two hundred billion dollars per year  that 's enough to provide care to all the people in america who don 't have <unk> it <unk> the trial lawyers say well this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine well that 's been studied too by the institute of medicine and others <unk> turns out that 's not the case <unk> the fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up are you sure that 's the <unk> because they 're not sure and they don 't want to take legal responsibility <unk>  let 's go to schools as we saw with the teacher in cody wyoming <unk>  she seems to be affected by the law <unk> well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law <unk> you could have a separate section of a law library around each <unk> <unk> of the following legal concepts due process special education no child left behind <unk>  <unk> rules it goes on we did a study of all the rules that affect one school in new york <unk> the board of ed had no idea <unk> tens of thousands of discreet rules sixty steps to suspend a student from school it 's a formula for paralysis what 's the effect of that one is a decline in order <unk> again studies have shown it 's directly attributable to the rise of due process <unk> agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago where they found that forty three percent of the high school teachers in america say that they spend at least half of their time maintaining order in the classroom  that means those students are getting half the learning they 're supposed to because if one child is disrupting the class no one can learn  and what happens when the teacher tries to assert order <unk> they 're threatened <unk> with a legal claim we also surveyed that seventy eight percent of the middle and high school teachers in america have been threatened by their students with violating their rights with lawsuits by their students they are threatening their students it 's not that they usually sue it 's not that they would win <unk> but it 's an indication of the corrosion of authority <unk> and how has this system of law worked for government it doesn 't seem to be working <unk> very well does it <unk> neither in sacramento nor in washington the other day at the state of the union speech president obama said and i think we could all agree with this goal from the first railroads to the interstate highway system our nation has always been the first to compete  there is no reason europe or china should have the fastest trains  <unk> actually there is a reason environmental review has evolved into a process of no pebble left unturned for any major project taking the better part of a decade <unk> then followed by years of litigation by anybody who doesn 't like the project  then just staying above the earth for one more second <unk> people are acting like idiots <unk> broward county <unk> florida banned running at recess that means all the boys are going to be add i mean it 's just absolutely a formula for for failure <unk> my favorite though are all the warning labels caution contents are hot on billions of coffee cups <unk> archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years and they won 't know about defensive medicine and stuff <unk> labels contents are extremely hot they 'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac that 's the only explanation because why would you have to tell people that something was actually hot <unk> my favorite warning was one on a five inch fishing lure i grew up in the south and whiled away the summers fishing five inch fishing lure it 's a big fishing lure with a three pronged hook in the back  <unk> none of these people are doing what they think is right and why not they don 't trust the law why don 't they trust the law <unk> because it gives us the worst of both worlds it 's random anybody can sue for almost anything and take it to a jury not even an effort at consistency and it 's also too detailed  in the areas that are regulated there are so many rules no human could possibly know <unk> it <unk> well how do you fix it we could spend ten thousand lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle <unk> but the challenge here is not one of just amending the law <unk> because the hurdle for success is trust  people for law to be the platform for freedom <unk> people have to trust <unk> that 's my second proposition trust is an essential condition to a free society <unk>  life is complicated enough without legal fear but law is different than other kinds of uncertainties <unk> because it carries with it the power of state <unk>  and so the state can come in it actually changes the way people think it 's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders all day long whispering <unk> could that go wrong might that go wrong it drives people from the smart part of the brain that dark <unk> deep well of the subconscious where instincts and experience  and all the other factors of creativity and good judgment are it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic pretty soon the doctor 's saying well i doubt if that headache could be a tumor but who would protect me <unk> so maybe i 'll just order the mri then you 've wasted two hundred billion dollars in unnecessary tests if you make people <unk> about their judgments <unk> studies show you will make them make worse judgments  if you tell the pianist to think about how she 's hitting the notes when she 's playing the piece she can 't play the piece is the enemy of accomplishment <unk> got no rules around here we 're trying to accomplish something  so how do you restore trust tweaking the law 's clearly not good enough and tort reform which is a great idea lowers your cost if you 're a businessperson <unk> but it 's like a band aid on this gaping <unk> <unk> wound of distrust states with extensive tort reform still suffer all these pathologies  <unk> out that freedom actually has a formal structure and it is this law sets boundaries <unk> and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you can 't do or must do you can 't steal you 've got to pay your taxes but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom <unk> isaiah berlin put <unk> law sets frontiers not artificially drawn <unk> within which men shall be inviolable  we 've forgotten that second part those dikes have burst people wade through law all day long  so what 's needed now is to rebuild these boundaries <unk>  and it 's especially important to rebuild them for lawsuits because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else 's freedom <unk>  if someone brings a lawsuit <unk> over a kid fell off the seesaw it doesn 't matter what happens in the lawsuit all the seesaws will disappear <unk>  because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit <unk> and that 's what 's happened there are no seesaws jungle gyms merry go rounds climbing ropes <unk> nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four because there 's no risk associated with it so how do we rebuild it <unk> life is too complex for <unk> a software program all these choices involve value judgments and social norms <unk> not objective facts <unk>  and so here is the fourth proposition  this is what we have the philosophy we have to change to and there are two essential elements of it <unk> we have to simplify the law <unk>  we have to migrate from all this complexity towards general principles and goals the constitution is only sixteen pages long <unk> worked pretty well for two hundred years  law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices if they can 't internalize it they won 't trust it <unk>  and how do you make it simple  because life is complex and here is the hardest and biggest change we have to restore the authority to judges <unk> and officials to interpret and apply the law  we have to rehumanize the law  to make law simple so that you feel free the people in charge have to be free to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law in accord with reasonable social norms <unk> as you <unk> going down and walking down the sidewalk during the day you have to think that if there is a dispute  there 's somebody in society who sees it as their job to affirmatively protect you if you 're acting reasonably that person doesn 't exist today  this is the hardest hurdle <unk> it 's actually not very hard ninety eight percent of cases this is a piece of cake maybe you 've got a claim in small claims court <unk> your lost pair of pants for $ one hundred <unk> but not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars <unk> case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court <unk> takes five minutes that 's it it 's not that hard <unk>  but it 's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand because we woke up in the <unk> 1960s to all these really bad values racism gender discrimination pollution they were bad values <unk> and we wanted to create a legal system where no one could have bad values anymore <unk> the problem is <unk> created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values it doesn 't mean that people in authority can do whatever they want they 're still bounded by legal goals and principles the teacher is accountable to the principal  the judge is accountable to an appellate court the president is accountable to voters <unk> but the accountability 's up the line judging the decision against the effect on everybody not just on the disgruntled person you can 't run a society by the lowest common denominator so what 's needed is a basic shift in philosophy we can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy  we 've been taught that authority <unk> authority is the enemy of freedom it 's not true authority in fact is essential law is a human institution <unk> responsibility is a human institution if teachers don 't have authority to run the classroom to maintain order everybody 's learning suffers if the judge doesn 't <unk> have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims <unk> then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders if the environmental agency can 't decide that the power lines are good for the environment <unk> then there 's no way to bring the power from the wind farms to the city  <unk> requires red lights and green lights <unk> otherwise it soon descends into gridlock that 's what 's happened to america <unk> so that we can begin to address the challenges of our
