 <unk> here 's a startling fact  in the forty five years since the introduction of the automated teller machine those vending machines that dispense cash <unk>  the number of human bank tellers employed in the united states has roughly doubled from about a quarter of a million to a half a million nine hundred and seventy to about a half a million today with one hundred thousand added since the year two thousand <unk>  these facts revealed in a recent book by boston university economist james bessen raise an intriguing question  what are all those tellers doing and why hasn 't automation eliminated their employment by now <unk> if you think about it many of the great inventions of the last two hundred years were designed to replace human labor <unk>  tractors were developed to substitute mechanical power for human physical toil <unk>  assembly lines were engineered to replace inconsistent human handiwork with machine perfection <unk> computers were programmed <unk> inconsistent human calculation with digital perfection  these inventions have worked <unk> we no longer dig ditches by hand <unk> pound tools out of wrought iron or do bookkeeping using actual books <unk>  and yet <unk> the fraction of us adults employed in the labor market is higher now in two thousand and sixteen than it was one hundred and twenty five years ago in <unk> and it 's risen in just about every decade in the intervening one hundred and twenty five years  this poses a paradox our machines increasingly do our work for us why doesn 't this make our labor redundant and our skills obsolete <unk>  why are there still so many jobs  laughter i 'm going to try to answer that question tonight <unk> and along the way i 'm going to tell you what this means for the future of work and the challenges that automation does and does not pose for our society <unk> why are there so many jobs  there are actually two fundamental economic principles at stake  one has to do with human genius and creativity <unk> the other has to do with human <unk> or greed if you like i 'm going to call the first of these the <unk> o ring principle and it determines the type of work that we do the second <unk> principle is the never get enough principle and it determines how many jobs there actually are let 's start with the automated teller machines had two countervailing effects on bank teller employment  as you would expect they replaced a lot of teller tasks the number of tellers per branch fell by about a third <unk> banks quickly discovered that it also was cheaper to open new branches and the number of bank branches increased by about forty percent in the same time period <unk>  the net result was more branches and more tellers <unk>  but those tellers were doing somewhat different work  as their routine cash handling tasks receded they became less like checkout clerks and more like salespeople <unk> forging relationships with customers <unk> solving problems and introducing them to new products like credit cards <unk> loans and investments more tellers doing a more cognitively demanding job <unk>  there 's a general principle here most of the work that we do requires a multiplicity of skills  and brains and brawn <unk> technical <unk> perspiration and inspiration in the words of thomas edison <unk>  in general <unk> automating some subset of those tasks doesn 't make the other ones unnecessary <unk> in fact <unk> it makes them more important <unk>  it increases their economic value <unk> let me give you a stark example in one thousand nine hundred and <unk> the space shuttle challenger exploded and crashed back down to earth less than two minutes after takeoff <unk>  the cause of that crash it turned out was an inexpensive rubber <unk> o ring in the booster rocket that had frozen on the launchpad the night before and <unk> <unk> failed catastrophically moments after takeoff <unk> in this multibillion dollar enterprise that simple rubber <unk> o ring made the difference between mission success and the calamitous death of seven astronauts  tragic setting is the <unk> o ring production function named by harvard economist michael kremer after the challenger disaster  the o ring production function conceives of the work as a series of interlocking steps links in a chain <unk> every one of those links must hold for the mission to succeed if any of them fails <unk> the mission or the product or the service <unk> comes crashing down  this precarious situation has a surprisingly positive implication  which is that improvements in the reliability of any one link in the chain increases the value of improving any of the other links  concretely <unk>  if most of the links are brittle and prone to breakage the fact that your link is not that reliable is not that important <unk> probably something else will break anyway but <unk> as all the other links become robust and reliable the importance of your link becomes more essential in the limit everything depends upon it  the reason the o ring was critical to space shuttle challenger is because everything else worked perfectly  if the challenger were kind of the space era equivalent of microsoft windows two thousand <unk> reliability of the o ring wouldn 't have mattered because the machine would have crashed  here 's the broader point <unk>  in much of the work that we do we are the <unk> o rings  yes <unk> atms could do certain <unk> cash handling tasks faster and better than tellers <unk>  but that didn 't make tellers superfluous <unk> it increased the importance of their <unk> relationships with customers <unk>  the same principle applies if we 're building a building if we 're diagnosing and caring for a patient or if we are teaching a class to a roomful of high schoolers <unk> as our tools improve <unk> technology magnifies our leverage and increases the importance of our expertise and our judgment and our creativity <unk> and that brings me to the second principle never get enough <unk>  you may be thinking ok <unk> o ring got it that says the jobs that people do will be important they can 't be done by machines but they still need to be done but that doesn 't tell me how many jobs there will need to be  if you think about it <unk> isn 't it kind of self evident that once we get sufficiently productive at something we 've basically worked our way out of a job <unk> percent of all us employment was on farms today <unk> it 's less than two percent why are there so few farmers today <unk>  it 's not because we 're eating less  a century of productivity growth in farming means that now a couple of million farmers can feed a nation of three hundred and twenty million that 's <unk> but it also means there are only so many o ring jobs left in farming so clearly technology can eliminate jobs farming is only one example there are many others like it <unk>  but what 's true about a single product or service or industry has never been true about the economy as a whole many of the industries in which we now work health and medicine <unk>  <unk> electronics and computing were tiny or barely existent a century ago many of the products that we spend a lot of our money on air conditioners sport utility vehicles computers and mobile devices were unattainably expensive or just hadn 't been invented a century ago  as automation frees our time increases the scope of what is possible we invent new products new ideas new services that command our attention occupy our time and spur consumption  you may think some of these things are frivolous extreme yoga <unk> adventure tourism pokmon go and i might agree with you  but people desire these things and they 're willing to work hard for them the average worker in two thousand and fifteen wanting to attain the average living standard in one <unk> and fifteen could do so by working just seventeen weeks a year one third of the time <unk>  but most people don 't choose to do that they are willing to work hard to harvest the technological bounty that is available to them  material abundance has never eliminated perceived scarcity in the words of economist thorstein veblen <unk>  invention is the mother of necessity <unk> so if you accept these two principles the <unk> o ring principle and the never get enough principle <unk> then you agree with me there will be jobs  does that mean there 's nothing to worry about automation employment robots and jobs it 'll all take care of itself  no  that is not my argument automation creates wealth by allowing us to do more work in less time there is no economic law that says that we will use that wealth well and that is worth worrying about  consider two countries <unk> norway and saudi arabia  both oil rich nations <unk> it 's like they have money spurting out of a hole in the ground  but they haven 't used that wealth equally well to foster human <unk> a thriving democracy by and large its citizens work and play well together <unk>  it 's typically numbered between first and fourth in rankings of national happiness <unk>  saudi arabia is an absolute monarchy in which many citizens lack a path for personal advancement it 's typically ranked <unk> among nations in happiness which is low for such a wealthy nation just by way of comparison the us is typically ranked around the difference between these two countries is not their wealth and it 's not their technology <unk> it 's their institutions <unk>  norway has invested to build a society with opportunity and economic mobility <unk> saudi arabia has raised living standards while frustrating many other human strivings <unk> both wealthy not equally well off and this brings me to the challenge that we face today the challenge that automation poses for us the challenge is not that we 're running out of work the us has added fourteen million jobs since the depths of the great recession <unk>  the challenge is that many of those jobs are not good jobs and many citizens cannot qualify for the good jobs that are being created  employment growth in the united states and in much <unk> much of the developed world looks something like a barbell with increasing poundage on either end of the bar on the one hand <unk> you <unk> <unk> jobs like doctors and nurses <unk> programmers and engineers <unk> marketing and sales managers employment is robust in these jobs employment growth similarly employment <unk> clerical and sales positions <unk> the reasons behind <unk> rules and procedures that can increasingly be codified in software and executed executed by computers <unk>  the challenge that this phenomenon creates creates what economists call employment polarization is that it knocks out rungs in the economic ladder <unk> shrinks the size of the middle <unk> <unk> class and threatens to make us a more stratified society <unk> on the one hand a set of highly paid <unk> educated professionals doing interesting work on the other a large number of citizens in low paid jobs whose primary responsibility is to see to the comfort and health of the affluent  that is not my vision of progress <unk> and i doubt that it is yours <unk>  but here is some encouraging news <unk> we have faced <unk> automation was eliminating vast numbers of agricultural jobs remember that tractor <unk>  the farm states faced a threat of mass unemployment a generation of youth no longer needed on the farm <unk> rising to this challenge they took the radical step of requiring that their entire youth population remain in school and continue their education to the ripe old age of sixteen  this was called the high school movement <unk> and it was a radically expensive thing to do not only did they have to invest in the schools <unk> but those kids couldn 't work at their jobs  <unk> it also turned out to be one of the best investments the us made in the 20th century it gave us the most skilled <unk> skilled the most flexible and the most productive workforce in the world to see how well this worked <unk> imagine taking the labor force of and ninety nine and bringing them into the present <unk>  despite their strong backs and good characters many of them would lack the basic literacy and numeracy skills to do all but the most mundane mundane jobs <unk> many of them would be unemployable  what this example highlights is the primacy of our institutions most especially our schools in allowing us to reap the harvest of our technological prosperity <unk>  it 's foolish to say there 's nothing to worry about clearly we can get this wrong <unk>  if the us had not invested in its schools and in its skills a century ago with the high school movement <unk> be a less prosperous a less mobile and probably a lot less happy society <unk>  but it 's equally foolish to say that our fates are sealed that 's not decided by the machines <unk> it 's not even decided by the market it 's decided by us and by our institutions <unk>  now <unk> i started this talk with a paradox our machines increasingly do our work for us why doesn 't that make our labor superfluous our skills redundant isn 't it obvious that the road to our economic and social hell is paved with our own great inventions history has repeatedly offered an answer to that paradox <unk> the first part of the answer is that technology magnifies our leverage increases the importance <unk> the added value of our expertise our judgment and our creativity  <unk> to do <unk>  adjusting to the rapid pace of technological change creates real challenges <unk> seen most clearly in our polarized labor market and the threat that it poses to economic mobility <unk>  rising to this challenge is not automatic <unk>  it 's not costless <unk> it 's not easy <unk> but it is feasible <unk> and here is some encouraging news because of our amazing productivity 're rich of course we can afford to invest in ourselves and in our children as america did a hundred years ago with the high school movement <unk>  arguably we can 't afford not to  now you may be thinking <unk> professor autor has told us a heartwarming tale about the distant past <unk> the recent past <unk> maybe the present <unk> probably not the future because everybody knows that this time is different <unk> right is this time different  of course this time is different <unk>  every time is different  on numerous occasions in the last two hundred years scholars and activists have raised the alarm that we are running out of work and making ourselves obsolete for example <unk> the luddites <unk> and of course many scholars pundits <unk> technologists and media figures today <unk>  these predictions strike me as arrogant <unk> <unk> oracles are in effect saying if i can 't think of what people will do for work in the future <unk> then you me and our kids aren 't going to think of it either  i don 't have the guts to take that bet against human ingenuity <unk>  look i can 't tell you what people are going to do for work a hundred years from now <unk>  but the future doesn 't hinge on my imagination <unk> if i were a farmer in iowa in the year one thousand nine hundred and an economist from the 21st century teleported down to my field and said hey guess what farmer autor  in the next hundred years agricultural employment is going to fall from forty percent of all jobs to two percent purely due to rising productivity what do you think the other thirty eight percent of workers are going to do  <unk> i wouldn 't have had a clue <unk>  but i hope i would have had the wisdom to say  wow a ninety five percent reduction in farm employment with no shortage of food  that 's an amazing amount of progress <unk> i hope that humanity finds something remarkable to do with all of that prosperity <unk> and by and large <unk> i would say that it has thank you very much
