 <unk> more of it than you think actually <unk> everything i would say everything that matters except every thing <unk> we can see matter <unk> but we can 't see what 's the matter <unk> as in this cryptic sentence i found in the guardian recently  the marriage suffered a setback in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five when the husband was killed by the wife  there 's a world of invisibility there isn 't there  <unk> we can see the stars and the planets but we can 't see what holds them apart or what draws them together  with matter as with people we see only the skin of things we can 't see into the engine room we can 't see what makes people tick  at least not without difficulty <unk> and the closer we look at anything <unk>  the more it disappears  in fact if you look really closely at stuff if you look at the basic substructure of matter <unk> there isn 't anything there electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz and there is only energy <unk> 't see energy <unk>  so everything that matters that 's important is invisible  one slightly silly thing that 's invisible is this story which is invisible to you <unk> and i 'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds <unk>  it 's about an m p called geoffrey dickens <unk>  the late geoffrey dickens m p was attending a fete in his constituency wherever he went at every stall he stopped he was closely followed by a devoted <unk> smiling woman of indescribable ugliness  try as he might he couldn 't get away from her  a few days later he received a letter from a constituent saying how much she admired him <unk> had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph <unk> after her name written in brackets was the apt description <unk> horse face  i 've misjudged this <unk> not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness she turns it to her advantage  a photo is not enough  so he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in and on the photograph he wrote with a flourish to horse face with love from geoffrey dickens m p  after it had been sent off his secretary said to him did you get that letter from the woman at the fete i wrote horse face on her so you 'd remember <unk> i bet he thought he wished he was invisible don 't you  so one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can 't see we also can 't understand gravity is one thing that we can 't see and which we <unk> <unk> don 't understand it 's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces and the weakest  <unk> and nobody really knows what it is or why it 's there for what it 's worth sir isaac newton the greatest scientist who ever lived  he thought jesus came to earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity that 's what he thought he was there for  so bright guy <unk> could be wrong on that one i don 't know  consciousness <unk> i see all your faces <unk> i have no idea what any of you are thinking isn 't that amazing isn 't that incredible that we can 't read each other 's minds but we can <unk> taste each other perhaps if we get close enough <unk> but we can 't read each other 's minds i find that quite astonishing  in the sufi faith this great middle eastern religion which some claim is the route of all religions sufi masters are all telepaths <unk>  so they say <unk> but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn 't exist <unk>  so that 's why we don 't think it exists the sufi masters working on us <unk> question of consciousness and artificial intelligence artificial intelligence has really like the study of consciousness gotten nowhere we have no idea how consciousness works  with artificial intelligence <unk> not only have they not created artificial intelligence they haven 't yet created artificial stupidity  <unk> remind you of anyone  interesting <unk>  i 'm as you can guess not a materialist i 'm an immaterialist and i 've found a very useful new word ignostic <unk> okay <unk> i 'm an ignostic <unk>  i refuse to be drawn on the question of whether god exists <unk> until somebody properly defines the terms  another thing we can 't see is the human genome <unk> and this is increasingly peculiar because about twenty years ago when they started delving into the genome <unk> they thought it would probably contain around one hundred thousand genes geneticists will know this but every year since it 's been revised downwards  we now think there are likely to be only just over twenty thousand genes in the human genome this is extraordinary <unk> because rice <unk> two more than people <unk> and the same as a gorilla  you can 't see these things but they are very strange  the stars by day i always think that 's fascinating <unk> the universe <unk> the more light there is the less you can see  time  nobody can see time i don 't know if you know this modern physics there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn 't really exist because it 's too inconvenient for the figures it 's much <unk> <unk> easier if if it 's not really there you can 't see the future obviously <unk> and you can 't see the past except in your memory one of the interesting things about the past is you particularly can 't see my son asked me this the other day he said dad can you remember what i was like when i was two and i said <unk> yes and he said why can 't i isn 't that extraordinary you cannot remember what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three which is great news for psychoanalysts because otherwise they 'd be out of a job because that 's where all the stuff happens  that makes you who you are  another thing you can 't see is the grid on which we hang this is fascinating <unk> you probably know some of you that cells are continually renewed you can see it in skin and this kind of stuff skin flakes off <unk> hairs grow nails that kind of stuff but every cell in your body is replaced at some point <unk>  taste buds every ten days or so <unk>  livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer a spine takes several years but at the end of seven years <unk> not one cell in your body remains from what was there seven years ago the question is who then <unk> we what are we what is this thing that we hang on that is actually us <unk>  okay <unk>  atoms you can 't see them nobody ever will they 're smaller than the wavelength of light <unk>  gas you can 't see that interesting somebody mentioned one thousand six hundred recently gas was invented in one thousand six hundred by a dutch chemist called van helmont <unk> it 's said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual <unk> quite good he also invented a word called blas meaning astral radiation didn 't catch on unfortunately  but well done him  there is so many things that light <unk> you can 't see light when it 's dark in a vacuum <unk> if a person shines <unk> some physicists will disagree with this but it 's odd that you can 't see the beam of light you can only see what it hits <unk> i find that extraordinary not to be able to see light not to be able to see darkness <unk> electricity you can 't see that don 't let anyone tell you they understand electricity they don 't nobody knows what it is  you probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire don 't you at the speed of light when you turn the light on they don 't electrons bumble down the wire about the <unk> of spreading honey they say  galaxies one hundred billion of them estimated in the universe one hundred billion how many can we see five <unk>  five out of the one hundred billion galaxies with the naked eye and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you 've got very good eyesight  radio waves there 's another thing heinrich hertz <unk> when he discovered radio waves <unk> and somebody said to him well what 's the point of these heinrich what 's the point of these radio waves that you 've found and he said well i 've no idea but i guess somebody will find a use for them someday  and that 's what they do radio that 's what they what they discovered  anyway <unk> so the biggest thing that 's invisible to us is what we don 't know it is incredible how little we know <unk> thomas edison <unk> once said we don 't know one percent of one millionth about anything and i 've come to the conclusion because you 've asked this other question what 's another thing you can 't see the point most of us what 's the point  you can 't see a point it 's by <unk> what i 've got it down to is there are only two questions really worth asking why are we here and what should we do about it while we are and to help you i 've got two things to leave you with from two great philosophers perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century one a mathematician and an engineer <unk>  and the other a poet <unk>  the first is ludwig wittgenstein who said i don 't know why we are here <unk> but i 'm pretty sure it 's not in order to enjoy ourselves <unk> i 've no idea
