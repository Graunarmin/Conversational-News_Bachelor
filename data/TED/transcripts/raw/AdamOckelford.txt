 <unk> i promise there won 't be too much of me talking and a lot of derek playing but i thought it would just be nice to recap on how derek got to where he is today  it 's amazing now because he 's so much bigger than but when derek was born he could have fitted on the palm of your hand he was born three and a half months premature <unk> and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive he had to have a lot of oxygen and that affected your eyes derek and also the way you understand language and the way you understand the world  but that was the end of the bad news because when derek came came home from the hospital <unk> his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny who was going to look after you derek really for the rest of your childhood  and nanny 's great insight really was to think  here 's a child who can 't see music must be the thing for for derek and sure enough she sang <unk> or as derek called it warbled  to him for him for his first few years of life and i think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after <unk> every day that made him think maybe you know in his brain something was stirring some sort of musical gift <unk> here 's a little picture of derek going up now when you were with your nanny now nanny 's great other insight was to think perhaps we should get derek something <unk> and sure enough she dragged this little keyboard out of the loft <unk>  never thinking really that anything much would come of it <unk>  but derek your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it <unk> bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break but out of all the bashing after a few months emerged the most fantastic music <unk> and i think there was just a miracle moment really derek when you realized that all the sounds you hear <unk> hear in the world out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard that was the great eureka moment  now not being able to see meant of course that you taught yourself derek paravicini i taught myself to play ao you did teach yourself to play and as a consequence playing the piano for you derek was a lot of knuckles and karate chops and even a bit of nose going on in there <unk> and now here 's what <unk> nanny did also do was to press the record button on one of those little early tape recorders that they had <unk> and this is a wonderful tape now of derek playing when you were four years old <unk> little child who can 't see can 't really understand much about the world <unk> has no one in the family who plays an instrument and yet he taught himself to play that and as you can see from the picture there was quite a lot of body action going on while you were playing derek  now <unk> along derek and i met when he was four and a half years old and at first derek i thought you were mad to be honest because when you played the piano you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard <unk> and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way so as soon as i tried to get near the piano <unk> shoved off and having said to to your dad nic that i would try to teach you i was then slightly confused as to how i might go about that if i wasn 't allowed near the piano <unk>  but after a while i thought well the only way is to just pick you up  shove derek over to the other side of the room <unk> and in the ten seconds that i got before derek came back <unk> i could just play something very quickly for him to learn <unk>  and in the end <unk> i think you agreed that we could actually have some fun playing the playing the piano together as you can see there 's me in my my early pre marriage days with a brown beard <unk> and little derek concentrating there  i just realized this is going to be recorded isn 't it right okay  now then by the age of ten derek really had taken the world by storm <unk> this is a photo of you <unk> playing at the barbican with the royal philharmonic pops basically it was it was just an exciting journey really and in those days derek you didn 't speak very much and so there was always a moment of tension as to whether you 'd actually understood what it was we were going to play and whether you 'd play the right piece in the right key and all that kind of thing but the orchestra were wowed as well and the press of the world were fascinated by your to play these fantastic pieces now the question is how do you do it derek and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do  i think that one of the first things that happened when when you were very little derek was that by the time you were two your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults <unk>  and so whenever you heard <unk> any note at all if i just play a random note you knew instantly what it was and you 'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano <unk> now that 's called perfect pitch and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes in the middle of the piano <unk> your ear is so much more than that if i just put the microphone down for a bit i 'm going to play a cluster of notes  those of you who can see will know how many notes but derek of course can 't not only can you say how many notes it 's being able to play them all at the <unk> that ability that ability to hear simultaneous sounds not only just single sounds but when a whole orchestra is playing derek you can hear <unk> through all those hours and hours of practice reproduce those on the keyboard that makes you <unk> i think is the basis of all your ability <unk>  now then  it 's no use having that kind of raw ability without the technique <unk> and luckily derek you decided that once we did start learning you 'd let me help you learn all the scale fingerings so for <unk> and in the end you got so quick that things like flight of the bumblebee playing things like this the <unk> thing was with all those scales derek <unk> you could not <unk> in your brain derek is this amazing musical computer that can instantly recalibrate <unk> recalculate all the pieces in the world that are out there most pianists would have a heart attack if you said  sorry do you mind playing ' flight of the bumblebee ' in b minor instead of a minor  as we went on in fact <unk> the first time derek <unk> you played that with an orchestra <unk> you 'd learned the version that you 'd learned and then the orchestra <unk> did have a different version so while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to play it with the orchestra <unk> fantastic chap the other wonderful thing about you is memory dp memory ao your memory is truly amazing and every concert we do we ask the audience <unk> not brave at all because if you ask for something that derek doesn 't know <unk> you 're invited to come and sing it first and then he 'll pick it up  so just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish <unk> but seriously would anyone like to the <unk> you may think thirteen hours is a long time to keep talking but derek does it effortlessly <unk> now then  laughter but in america they 've coined this term the human ipod for derek <unk> which i think is just missing the point really because derek <unk> much more than an ipod you 're a fantastic creative musician <unk> and i think that was nowhere clearer to see really than when we went to slovenia <unk>  and someone in a longer concert we we tend to get people joining in and this person very very nervously came onto the stage <unk> i should really get derek 's manager to come and play it he 's sitting there <unk> okay the thought that all the world was a piano so whenever art tatum plays something it sounds like there 's three pianos in the room <unk> and here is derek 's take on art tatum the <unk> for
