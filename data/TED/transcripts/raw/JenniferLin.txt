 the the the the the the the <unk> like the speaker before me i am a ted virgin i guess <unk> i 'm also the <unk> anderson invited me i 'm really grateful that i get a chance to play for everyone <unk>  and the song that i just played was by josef hofmann it 's called kaleidoscope and hofmann is a polish pianist and composer of the late <unk> and he 's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time i have another piece that i 'd like to play for you it 's called abegg variations by robert schumann a german but he wrote that for his wife  so actually if you listen carefully there are supposed to be five variations on this abegg theme <unk> it 's written around one thousand eight hundred and thirty four so even though it 's old i hope you 'll like it <unk> oh the the <unk> ok the <unk> ok the the <unk> ok <unk> me that this session is called sync and flow i was wondering what do i know that these geniuses don 't  so i 'll talk about musical composition even though i don 't know where to start <unk> how do i compose <unk> i think yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose what i do first <unk> i make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano and i choose one of those to become my main theme my main melody <unk> like the abegg that you just heard  and once i choose my main theme <unk> i have to decide out of all the styles in music what kind of style do i want  and this year i composed a romantic style so for inspiration i listened to liszt and tchaikovsky and all the great romantic composers  next i make the structure of the <unk> entire piece with my teachers <unk> they help me plan out the whole piece <unk> and then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas because then you have to think  laughter and then when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form solidified excuse me solidified form you 're supposed to actually polish the piece polish the details and then polish the overall performance of the composition  and another thing that i enjoy doing is drawing <unk> drawing because i like to draw you know japanese anime art <unk> i think that 's a craze among teens right now <unk> and once i realized it there 's a parallel between creating music and creating art <unk> because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing it 's your character you want to decide who you want to draw or if you want to draw an original character <unk> and then you want to decide how are you going to draw the character  like am i going to use one page am i going to draw it on the computer am i going to use a two page spread like like a comic book for a more grandiose effect i guess <unk> and then you have to do the initial sketch of the character which is like your structure of a piece <unk> and then you add pen and pencil and whatever details that you need that 's polishing the <unk> drawing <unk> and another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind <unk> because i know i 'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted so if i 'm trying to do homework and i don 't feel like it i 'll try to draw or you know waste my time <unk> and then what happens is sometimes i absolutely can 't draw or i can 't compose at all <unk> and then it 's like there 's too much on your mind you can <unk> 't focus on what you 're supposed to do and sometimes if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it you 'll get something out of it but it doesn 't come naturally <unk> what happens is if something magical happens if something natural happens to you you 're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly <unk>  and then that 's what i consider flow because that 's when everything clicks <unk> and you 're able to do anything you feel like you 're on top of your game and you can do anything you want <unk> i 'm not going to play my own composition today because although i did finish it it 's way too long <unk> instead i 'd like to try something called improvisation i have here seven note cards <unk> one with each note of the musical alphabet and i 'd like someone to come up here and choose five <unk> to come up here and choose five and then i can make it into some sort of melody and i 'll improvise it <unk> would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose <unk> i 'm going to try to put that in some sort of order <unk> i 'm going to have a moment to think and i 'll try to make something out of it <unk> ok <unk> ok <unk> ok the <unk> the next song or the encore that i 'm going to play is called the the the
