 <unk> so i have bad news <unk> i have good news <unk> and i have a task <unk>  so the bad news is that we all get sick <unk> i get sick <unk> you get sick <unk>  and every one of us gets sick and the question really is how sick do we get is it something that kills us is it something that we survive is it something that we can <unk> treat <unk> and we 've gotten sick as long as we 've been people <unk> and so we 've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick <unk>  and for a long time it was the gods right the gods are angry with me or the gods are testing me right  or god <unk> singular more recently is punishing me or judging me <unk>  and as long as we 've looked for <unk> we 've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science <unk> which is hypotheses as to why we get sick <unk>  and as long as we 've had hypotheses about why we get sick we 've tried to treat it as well so this is avicenna he wrote a book over a thousand years ago called the canon of medicine  and the rules he laid out for testing medicines are actually really similar to the rules we have today that the disease and the medicine must be the same strength the medicine needs to be pure <unk> and in the end we need to test it in people <unk> and so if you put together these themes of a narrative or a hypothesis in human testing  right you get some beautiful results even when we didn 't have very good technologies this is a guy named carlos finlay <unk>  he had a hypothesis that was way outside the box for his time in the late <unk> 1800s he thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing  he thought it was transmitted by mosquitos <unk>  and they laughed at him for twenty years they called this guy the mosquito man  but he ran an experiment in people <unk> hypothesis and he tested it in people  so he got volunteers to go move to cuba and live in tents and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever <unk> so some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes and some of the people were in tents that were full of mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever <unk>  and it definitively proved that it wasn 't this magic dust called fomites in your clothes that caused yellow fever but it wasn 't until we tested it in people that we actually knew <unk>  and this is what those people signed up for this is what it looked like to have yellow fever in cuba at that time you suffered in a tent  in the heat <unk> alone and you probably died <unk>  but people volunteered for this <unk>  and it 's not just a cool example of a scientific design of experiment in theory they also did this beautiful thing they signed this document <unk> and it 's <unk> an informed consent document and informed consent is an idea that we should be very proud of as a society right it 's something that separates us from the nazis at nuremberg <unk>  enforced medical experimentation it 's the idea that agreement to join a study without understanding isn 't agreement  it 's something that protects us from harm from <unk> from people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical study that we don 't understand or that we don 't agree to <unk> and so you put together the thread of narrative hypothesis experimentation in humans and informed consent and you get what we call clinical study <unk> and it 's how we do the vast majority of medical work it doesn 't really matter if you 're in the north the south the east the west  clinical studies form the basis of how we <unk> to look at a new drug right we test it in people we draw blood <unk> we do experiments <unk> and we gain consent for that study to make sure that we 're not screwing people over as part of it <unk>  but the world is changing around the clinical study which has been fairly well established for tens of years if not fifty to one hundred years  so now we 're able to gather data about our genomes but as we saw earlier our genomes aren 't dispositive <unk> we 're able to gather information about our environment <unk>  and more importantly we 're able to gather information about our choices because it turns out that what we think of as our health is more like the interaction of our bodies our genomes our choices and our environment <unk>  and the clinical methods that we 've got aren 't very good at studying that because they are based on the idea of person to person interaction you interact with your doctor and you get enrolled in the study <unk>  so this is my grandfather i actually never met him but he 's holding my mom and his genes are in <unk> right <unk> his choices ran through to me <unk> he was a smoker like most people were this is my son <unk>  so my grandfather 's genes go all the way through to him <unk> and my choices are going to affect his health  the technology between these two pictures cannot be more different but the methodology for clinical studies has not radically changed over that time period we just have better statistics <unk> the way we gain informed consent was formed in large part after world war ii around the time that picture was taken that was seventy years ago <unk>  and the way we gain informed consent this tool that was created to protect us from harm <unk> now creates silos <unk> so the data that we collect for prostate cancer or for alzheimer 's trials goes into silos where it can only be used for prostate cancer or for alzheimer 's research right it can 't be networked <unk> it can 't be integrated <unk> it cannot be used by people who aren 't credentialed <unk>  so a physicist can 't get access to it without filing paperwork a computer scientist can 't get access to it without filing paperwork <unk> computer scientists aren 't patient <unk>  they don 't file paperwork <unk>  and this is an accident these are <unk> tools that we created to protect us from harm but what they 're doing is protecting us from innovation now  and that wasn 't the goal it wasn 't the point right it 's a side effect if you will of a power we created to take us for good  and so if you think about it <unk> the depressing thing is that facebook would never make a change to something as important as an advertising algorithm with a sample size as small as a phase iii clinical trial <unk>  we cannot take the information <unk> from past trials and put them together to form statistically significant samples <unk>  and that sucks right so forty five percent of men develop cancer thirty eight percent of women develop cancer one in four men dies of cancer  one in five women dies of cancer at least in the united states <unk>  and three out of the four drugs we give you if you get <unk> and this is personal to me my sister is a cancer survivor my mother in law is a cancer survivor cancer sucks <unk>  and when you have it you don 't have a lot of privacy in the hospital you 're naked the vast majority of the time people you don 't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you  and when i tell cancer survivors that this tool we created to protect them is actually preventing their data from being used  especially when only three to four percent of people who have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study <unk> is not thank you god for protecting my privacy it 's outrage that we have this information and we can 't use it and it 's an accident <unk>  so the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous  two hundred and twenty six billion a year is spent on cancer in the united states <unk> fifteen hundred people a day die in the united states <unk> and it 's getting worse <unk>  so the good news is that some things have changed and the most important thing that 's changed is that we can now measure ourselves in ways that used to be the dominion of the health system <unk>  so a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust i like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid  we can reach back and grab that dust <unk> and we can learn a lot about health from it so if our choices are part of our health what we eat is a <unk> really important aspect of our health so you can do something very simple and basic and take a picture of your food and if enough people do that we can learn a lot about how our food affects our health  one interesting thing that came out of this this is an app for iphones called the eatery is that we think our pizza is significantly healthier than other people 's pizza is okay and it seems like a trivial result but this is the sort of research that used to take the health system years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to accomplish it was done in five months by a startup <unk> company of a couple of people i don 't have any financial interest in it  but more nontrivially we can get our genotypes done and although our genotypes aren 't dispositive they give us clues <unk>  so i could show you mine it 's just a 's t 's c 's and g 's this is the interpretation of it as you can see i carry a thirty two percent risk of prostate cancer twenty two percent risk of psoriasis and a fourteen percent risk of alzheimer 's disease <unk>  so that means if you told everyone you carry the apoe e4 allele what 's wrong with you right  when i got these results i started talking to doctors and they told me not to tell anyone and my reaction is is that going to help anyone cure me when i get the disease  and no one could tell me yes <unk>  and i live in a web world where when you share things beautiful stuff happens not bad stuff so i started putting this in my slide decks <unk> and i got even more obnoxious <unk> to my doctor and i said i 'd like to actually get my bloodwork <unk>  please give me back my data so this is my most recent bloodwork as you can see i have high cholesterol <unk> i have particularly high bad cholesterol <unk> and i have some bad liver numbers but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine the night before we ran the test  but look at how non computable this information <unk> this is like the the photograph of my granddad holding my mom from a data perspective <unk> and i had to go into the system and get it out <unk>  so the thing that i 'm proposing we do here is that we reach behind us and we grab the dust that we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype  and we reach into the medical system and we grab our records <unk> and we use it to build something together <unk> which is a commons  <unk> a commons is nothing more than a public good that we build out of private goods <unk> we do it voluntarily and we do it through standardized legal tools we do it through standardized technologies  right that 's all a commons is it 's something that we build together because we think it 's important  and a commons of data is something that 's really unique because we make it from our own data <unk>  and although a lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control around data and obsess around privacy at least some <unk> of us really like to share as a form of control  and what 's remarkable about digital commonses is you don 't need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough to generate something massive and beautiful  so not that many programmers write free software <unk> but we have the apache web server  not that many people who read wikipedia edit <unk> but it works <unk> so as long as some people like to share as their form of control we can build a commons as long as we can get the information out  and in biology the numbers are even better so vanderbilt ran a study asking people we 'd like to take your biosamples your blood and share them in a biobank and only five percent of the people opted out  i 'm from tennessee it 's not the most science positive state in the united states of america  but only five percent of the people wanted out <unk> so people like to share <unk> if you give them the opportunity and the choice <unk> and the reason that i got obsessed with this besides the obvious family aspects is that i spend a lot of time around mathematicians  and mathematicians are drawn to places where there 's a lot of data because they can use it to tease signals out of noise <unk>  and those correlations that they can tease out they 're not necessarily causal agents <unk> but math in this day and <unk> is like a giant set of power tools that we 're leaving on the floor not plugged in in health while we use hand saws  if we have a lot of shared genotypes and a lot of shared outcomes and a lot of shared lifestyle choices and a lot of shared environmental information  we can start to tease out the correlations between subtle variations in people <unk> the choices they make and the health that they create <unk> as a result of those choices and there 's open source infrastructure to do all of this sage bionetworks is a nonprofit that 's built a giant math system that 's waiting for data  but there isn 't any  so that 's what i do i 've actually started what we think is the world 's first fully digital fully <unk> unlimited in scope <unk> global in participation ethically approved clinical research study where you contribute the data <unk>  so if you reach behind yourself and you grab the dust if you reach into your body and grab your genome if you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record  you can actually go through an online informed consent process because the donation to the commons must be voluntary and it must be informed and you can actually upload your information and have it syndicated to the mathematicians who will do this sort of big data research <unk> and the goal is to get one hundred thousand in the first year and a million in the first five years so that we have a statistically significant cohort that you can use to take smaller sample sizes from traditional research and map it against  so that you can use it to tease out those subtle correlations between the variations that make us unique and the kinds of health that we need to to move forward as a society <unk> and i 've spent a lot of <unk> time around other commons i 've been around the early web i 've been around the early creative commons world and there 's four things that all of these share which is they 're all really simple  and so if you were to go to the website and enroll in this study you 're not going to see something complicated but it 's not simplistic  these things are weak intentionally <unk> right because you can always add power and control to a system <unk> but it 's very difficult to remove those things if you put them in at the beginning <unk>  and so being simple doesn 't mean being simplistic and being weak <unk> doesn 't mean weakness those are strengths in the system and open doesn 't mean that there 's no money  closed systems corporations make a lot of money on the open web <unk> and they 're one of the reasons why the open web lives is that corporations have a vested interest in the openness of the system  and so all of these things are <unk> of the clinical study that we 've created so you can actually come in all you have to be is fourteen years old willing to sign a contract that says i 'm not going to be a jerk <unk> basically <unk>  and you 're in you can start analyzing the data <unk> you do have to solve a captcha as well  and if you 'd like to build corporate structures on top of it that 's okay too that 's all in the consent <unk>  so if you don 't like those terms you don 't come in it 's very much the design principles of a commons that we 're trying to bring to health data and the other thing about these systems is that it only takes a small number of really unreasonable people working together to create them it didn 't take that many people to make wikipedia wikipedia or to keep it wikipedia <unk>  and we 're not supposed to be unreasonable in health and so i hate this word patient i don 't like being patient when systems are broken <unk>  and health care is broken <unk> politics of health care i 'm talking about the way we scientifically approach health care <unk> so i don 't want to be patient <unk> and the task i 'm giving to you is to not be patient <unk>  so i 'd like you to actually try when you go home to get your data you 'll be shocked and offended and i would bet outraged at how hard it is to get it <unk> but it 's a challenge that i hope you 'll take and maybe you 'll share it <unk> maybe you won 't if you don 't have anyone in your family who 's sick maybe you wouldn <unk> be unreasonable  but if you do or if you 've been sick <unk> then maybe you would  and we 're going to be able to do an experiment in the next several months that lets us know exactly how many unreasonable people are out there  so this is the athena breast health network it 's a study of one hundred and fifty thousand women in california <unk>  and they 're going to return all the data to the participants of the study in a computable <unk> to load it into the study that i 've put together so we 'll know exactly how many people are willing to be unreasonable
