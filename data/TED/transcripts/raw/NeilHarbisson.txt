 <unk> i was born with with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia which is total color blindness <unk>  so i 've never seen color and i don 't know what color looks like  because i come from a grayscale world to me the sky is always gray <unk> flowers are always gray and television is still in black and white <unk> but since the age of <unk> instead of seeing color i can hear color  in two thousand and three i started a project with computer scientist adam montandon <unk> and the result with further collaborations with <unk> from slovenia and matias lizana from barcelona is this electronic eye <unk> it 's a color sensor that detects the color frequency in front of me  and sends this frequency to a chip installed at the back of my head <unk> and i hear the color in front of me through the bone through bone conduction <unk> i 've been hearing color all the time for eight <unk> since two thousand and four <unk> so i find it completely normal now to hear color all the time <unk> at the start though i had to memorize the the names you give for each color so i had to memorize the notes <unk> but after some time all this information became a perception <unk> i didn 't have to think about the notes <unk> and after some time this perception became a feeling i started to have favorite colors and i started to dream in colors so <unk> when i started to dream in color is when i felt that the software and my brain had united because in my dreams <unk> it was my brain creating electronic sounds it wasn 't the software so that 's when i started to feel like a cyborg it 's when i started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device it had become a part of my body <unk> an extension of my <unk> and after some time <unk> it even became a part of my official image <unk> this is my passport from two thousand and four you 're not allowed to appear on u k passports with electronic equipment <unk> but i insisted to the passport office that <unk> what they were seeing was actually a new part of my body <unk> an extension of my brain and they finally accepted me to appear with the passport <unk> life has changed dramatically since i hear color <unk> because color is almost everywhere so the biggest change for example is going to an art gallery <unk> i can listen to a picasso for example so it 's like i 'm going to a concert hall because i can listen to the paintings and supermarkets i find this is very shocking it 's very very attractive to walk along a supermarket it 's like going to a nightclub it 's full of different melodies <unk> especially the aisle with cleaning products it 's just fabulous  laughter also the way i dress has changed before i used to dress in a way that it looked good now i dress in a way that it sounds good  so today i 'm dressed in c major <unk> so it 's quite a happy chord if i had to go to a funeral though i would dress in b minor which would be turquoise <unk> purple and orange  laughter also food  the way i look at food has changed <unk> because now i can display the food on a plate <unk> so i can eat my favorite song so depending on how i <unk> display it i can hear and i can compose music with food so imagine a restaurant where we can have like <unk> lady gaga salads as starters i mean  this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables probably <unk>  and also some rachmaninov piano concertos as main dishes <unk> and some bjork or madonna desserts that would be a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat songs <unk> also the way i perceive beauty has changed because when i look at someone i hear their face so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible and it might happen the opposite <unk>  the other way around so i really enjoy creating like sound portraits of people instead of drawing someone 's face like drawing the shape i point at them with the eye <unk> and i write down the different notes i hear and then i create sound portraits here 's some faces <unk> never relate but they sound similar <unk> prince charles has some similarities with nicole kidman they have similar sound of eyes so you relate people that you wouldn 't relate <unk>  and you can actually also create concerts by looking at the audience faces so i connect the eye and then i play the audience 's faces the good thing about this is if the concert doesn 't sound good <unk> it 's their fault <unk> it 's not my fault so another thing that happens is that i started having this secondary effect that normal sounds started to become color <unk> i heard a telephone tone <unk> and it it felt green because it sounded just like the color green the bbc beeps  they sound turquoise <unk> and listening to mozart became a yellow experience <unk> so i started to <unk> paint music and paint people 's voices because people 's voices have frequencies that i relate to color <unk> and here 's some music translated into into color for example <unk> mozart queen of the night looks like this very yellow and very colorful because there 's many different frequencies <unk> very pink and very yellow so also voices i can transform speeches into into color <unk> for example <unk> these are two very <unk> one of them is martin luther king 's i have a dream and the other one is hitler and i like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels <unk> <unk> and then i ask people which one do you prefer and most people change their preference when i tell them that the one on the left is hitler <unk> vision i was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel but then i just thought that this human vision wasn wasn 't good enough there 's many many more colors around us that we cannot perceive <unk> but that electronic eyes can perceive so <unk> i decided to continue extending my color senses <unk> and i added hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive for example perceiving infrared is good because you can actually detect if there 's movement detectors in a room i can hear if someone points at me with a remote control <unk> and the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that you can hear if it 's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe <unk> because ultraviolet is a dangerous color <unk> color that can actually kill us so i think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we we cannot perceive that 's why two years ago <unk> i created the cyborg foundation which is a foundation that tries to help people become a cyborg <unk> tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body <unk> we should all think that knowledge comes from our senses so if we extend our senses we will consequently extend our knowledge  i think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body i think this will <unk> <unk> be a big big change that we will see during this century <unk> so i do encourage you all to think about <unk> senses you 'd like to extend <unk> i would encourage you to become a cyborg you won 't be alone thank
