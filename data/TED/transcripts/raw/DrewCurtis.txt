 <unk> by a company called gooseberry natural resources <unk> owned a patent for the creation and distribution of news releases via email  now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented but it does happen all the time <unk> take something already being done and patent it for an emerging technology like phone calls on the internet or video listings for tv shows or radio but for cellphones <unk> and so on the <unk> problem with these patents is that the mechanisms are obscure and the patent system is dysfunctional <unk> and as a result most of these lawsuits end in settlements  and because these settlements are under a non disclosure agreement no one knows what the terms were <unk> and as a result the patent troll can claim that they won the case  in the case of gooseberry natural <unk> this patent on emailing news releases had sort of a fatal flaw as it pertained to myself <unk>  and that was that in the mainstream media world there is only one definition for news release <unk> and it turns out that is press release as in p r  now my company fark <unk> deals with news ostensibly <unk>  and as a result we were not in violation of this patent so case closed right <unk> one of the major problems with patent law is that in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent is actually on the defendant <unk>  which means you have to prove that you do not infringe on the patent they 're suing you on and this can take quite a while  you need to know that the average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes eighteen months when you win  that is your best case <unk> outcome when you get sued by a patent troll <unk>  now i had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit but one by one they settled out of the case <unk>  even though and this is important none of these companies infringed on this patent not a one of them  and they started settling out  the reason they settled out is because it 's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit clearly two million <unk> dollars cheaper in some cases and much worse if you actually lose <unk> it would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company especially a small eight man shop like my company <unk>  six months into the lawsuit we finally reached the discovery phase <unk> and in discovery phase we asked the patent troll to please provide screenshots of fark where the infringement of their patent was actually occurring <unk>  now perhaps it 's because no <unk> such screenshots actually existed <unk> but suddenly gooseberry wanted to settle their attorney  ah yes <unk> my company 's having a reorganization on our end never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in northern l a with no employees  and we 'd like to go ahead and close this out so would you mind <unk> we didn 't have high hopes for that outcome  but they settled no counter offer <unk>  now as mentioned before one of the reasons i can talk to you about this is because there 's no non disclosure agreement on this case now how did that happen  well during the settlement process when we received our copy <unk> i struck it my attorney said nah no chance of that working it came back signed <unk>  now why you can call them they 're not under nda either  now what did i learn from this case <unk> well three things <unk>  first of all if you can don 't fight the patent fight the infringement  patents are very difficult to overturn infringement is a lot easier to disprove <unk> make it clear from the beginning that either you have no money at all or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll than actually giving them the money <unk>  now the reason this works is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they 're able to recover in settlements  if it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money they become less interested in pursuing the case <unk>  finally make sure that you can tell them <unk> that you will make this process as annoying and as painful and as difficult as possible for them <unk>  now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way it turns out because they 're paid on contingency it works really really well in reverse don 't forget that  so what does all this mean well to sum up it boils down to one thing <unk> don 't negotiate with terrorists patent trolls have done more damage to the united states economy than any domestic <unk> or foreign terrorist organization in history every year <unk>  plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits <unk> now this is the point in the talk where i 'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system and the problem with that is that there are two very large industry groups that have different outcomes in mind for the patent system <unk>  the health care industry would like stronger protections for inventors the hi tech industry would like stronger protections for producers <unk>  and these goals aren 't necessarily diametrically opposed but they are at odds <unk> and as a result patent trolls can kind of <unk> live in the space in between so unfortunately i 'm not smart enough to have a solution for the patent troll problem however i did have this idea <unk>  and it was kind of good <unk> and i thought i should patent this  behold patent infringement via mobile device defined as a computer which is not stationary <unk> my solution award me this patent and i will troll them out of existence <unk> thank you
