 <unk> this is your conference <unk>  and i think you have a right to know a little bit right now in this transition period about this guy who 's going to be looking after it for you for a bit  so i 'm just going to grab a chair here two years ago at ted  i think i 've come to this conclusion i think i may have been suffering from a strange delusion <unk>  i think that i may have believed unconsciously <unk> was kind of a business hero <unk>  i had this company that i 'd spent fifteen years building it 's called future it was a magazine publishing company it had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars a number i i didn 't really understand  a magazine i 'd recently launched called <unk> business two point zero was fatter than a telephone directory <unk> busy pumping hot air into the bubble  and i was i was the forty percent owner of a of a dotcom that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more and all this had come from <unk> fifteen years earlier i was a science journalist who people just laughed at when i said i really would like to start my own computer magazine  and fifteen years later there are one hundred of them and two thousand people on staff and it was it was just such heady times the date was february two thousand i thought the little graph <unk> business life that kind of looked a bit like moore 's law ever upward and to the right it was going to go on forever i mean it had to right  i was in for quite a surprise <unk> the dotcom ironically called snowball was the very last consumer web company to go public the next month before nasdaq exploded <unk> i watched everything that i 'd built crumbling and it looked like all this stuff was going to die and and fifteen years work would have come for nothing and it was gut wrenching <unk> it took eight years of blood sweat and tears to reach three hundred and fifty employees something which i was very proud of in the business february two thousand and one in one day we laid off three hundred and fifty people  and before the bloodshed was finished one thousand people had lost their jobs from from my companies <unk> i felt sick <unk> i watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a <unk> every day for eighteen months  and worse than that far worse than that  my sense of self worth was kind of evaporating i was going around with this big sign on my forehead loser and i think what disgusts me more than anything looking back is how the hell did i let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing well in the end we were able to save future and snowball but i was at that point <unk> ready to move on and to cut a long story short <unk> here 's where i came to  and the reason i 'm telling this story is that i believe from many conversations that a lot of <unk> have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster emotional rollercoaster in the last couple years this has been a big big transition time <unk> and i believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever 's next the theme next year is re birth it was at the same ted two years ago when richard and i reached an agreement on the <unk> future of ted <unk> and at about the same time <unk> and i think partly because of that i started doing something that i 'd forgotten about in my business focus <unk> i started to read again <unk> and i discovered that while i 'd been busy playing business games there 'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology to all this stuff had had changed and the way in which you could think about us as a as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much and it was incredibly exciting and what was really most exciting and i i think richard wurman discovered this at least twenty years before i did was that all this stuff connected it 's connected it all hooks into each other we talk about this a lot and i thought about trying to give an example of of this so just one example <unk> madame de gaulle the wife of the french president was famously asked once what do you most desire  and she answered <unk> when you think about it <unk> it 's very true <unk> what we all most desire is a penis or  happiness as we say in english  and something  good luck with that one in the japanese translation room applause but something as basic <unk> <unk> as happiness <unk> which twenty years ago would have been just something for discussion in the in the church or mosque or synagogue <unk> you can ask about it which are really interesting you can ask about what causes it biochemically <unk> neuroscience <unk> serotonin all that stuff  you can ask what are the psychological causes of it <unk> nature nurture <unk> current circumstance turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind blowing  you can view it as a computing problem an artificial intelligence problem  do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it <unk> work properly you can view it in sort of geopolitical terms and say <unk> why is it that a billion people on this planet are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of of happiness <unk> and whereas almost all the rest of them  regardless of how much money they have whether it 's two dollars a <unk> did our genes invent this as a kind of trick to get us to behave in certain ways the ant 's brain parasitized to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate are we the victims of a mass delusion <unk> and <unk> to understand even something as important to us as happiness you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions and there 's nowhere that i 've discovered other than ted where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions <unk> and so <unk> it 's the profound thing that richard talks about to understand anything <unk>  you just need to understand the little bits a little bit about everything that surrounds it <unk> and so gradually over these <unk> three days <unk> you start off kind of trying to figure out why am i listening to all this irrelevant stuff and at the end of the four days <unk> your brain is humming and you feel energized alive and excited and it 's because all these different bits have been put together it 's the total brain experience we 're going to it 's the mental equivalent of the full body massage <unk> enough of the theory chris tell us what you 're actually going to do all right  so i will <unk> here 's the vision for ted number one  do nothing <unk> this thing ain 't broke so i ain 't gonna fix it <unk> <unk> jeff bezos kindly remarked to me chris ted is a really great <unk> you 're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad <unk> i gave myself the job title of ted custodian ted custodian for a reason <unk> and i will promise you right here and now that the core values that make ted special are not going to be interfered with  truth  <unk> no platforms  just the pursuit of interest wherever it lies across all the disciplines that are represented here that 's not going to be changed at all  number two i am going to put together an incredible line up of <unk> speakers for next year the time scale on which ted operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines <unk> there 's a year to do this and already i hope to show you a bit later there 's twenty five or so terrific speakers signed up for next year and i 'm getting fantastic help from the community this is just such <unk> our contacts reach pretty much everyone who 's interesting in the country if not the planet it 's true number three i do want to if i can  find a way of extending the ted experience throughout throughout the year a little bit and one key way that we 're going to do this is to introduce this <unk> books kind of saved me in the last couple years and that that 's a gift that i would like to pass on so when you sign up for <unk> every six weeks you 'll get a care package with a book or two and a reason why they 're linked to ted  they may well be by a ted speaker <unk> and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year <unk> having had the same intellectual emotional journey <unk> i think it
