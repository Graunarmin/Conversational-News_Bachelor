 <unk> talking about empowerment is odd <unk> because when we talk about empowerment what affects us most are the stories <unk>  so i want to begin with an everyday story what is it really like to be a young woman in india now  i 've spent the last twenty seven years of my life in india <unk> lived in three small towns two major cities and i 've had several experiences <unk>  when i was seven a private tutor who used to come home to teach me mathematics molested me  he would put his hand up my skirt  he put his hand up <unk> skirt and told me he knew how to make me feel good at seventeen a boy from my high school circulated an email detailing all the sexually aggressive things he could do to me because i didn 't pay attention to him  at nineteen <unk> i helped a friend whose parents had forcefully married her to an older <unk> man escape an abusive marriage  at twenty one when my friend and i were walking down the road one afternoon  a man pulled down his pants and masturbated in front of us  we called people for help and nobody came  <unk> when i was walking home one evening <unk>  two men on a motorcycle attacked me <unk> i spent two nights in the hospital recovering from trauma and injuries <unk>  so throughout my life i 've seen women family friends colleagues live through these experiences <unk> and they seldom talk about it  so in simple words life in india is not easy but today i 'm not going to talk to you about this fear i 'm going to talk to you about an interesting path of learning that this fear took me on  so what happened one night in december two thousand and twelve changed my life <unk>  so a young girl a 23 year old student <unk> boarded a bus in delhi with her male friend  there were six men on <unk> the bus young men who you might encounter every day in india <unk> and the chilling account of what followed was played over and over again in the indian and international media  this girl was raped repeatedly <unk>  forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod <unk> beaten <unk> bitten and left to die  her friend was gagged attacked and knocked unconscious she died on the 29th of december  and at a time when most of us here were preparing to welcome the new year india plunged into darkness  for the first time in our history men and women in indian cities woke up to the horrific truth about the true state of women in the country <unk> like many other young women i was absolutely terrified i couldn 't believe that something like this could happen in a national capital <unk>  i was angry and i was frustrated <unk>  but most of all i felt utterly completely helpless <unk>  but really what do you do right some write blogs some ignore it some join protests i did all of it in fact that was what everyone was doing two years ago so the media was filled with stories about all the horrific deeds that indian men are capable of  they were compared to animals sexually repressed beasts in fact so alien and unthinkable was this event in an indian mind that the response from the indian media public and politicians proved one point  no one knew what to do and no one wanted to be responsible for it  in fact these were a few insensitive comments which were made in the media by prominent people in response to sexual violence against women in general <unk>  so the first one is made by a member of parliament the second one is made by a spiritual leader <unk> and the third one was actually the defendants <unk> when the girl was fighting for her life and she passed away  now as a woman watching this day after day i was tired <unk>  so as a writer and gender activist i have written extensively on women  but this time i realized it was different because a part of me realized i was a part of that young woman too  and i decided i wanted to change this so i did something spontaneous hasty <unk> i logged <unk> citizen journalism platform called ireport <unk>  and i recorded a video talking about what the scene was like in bangalore <unk>  i talked about how i felt i talked about the ground realities and i talked about the frustrations of living in india <unk>  in a few hours <unk> the blog was shared widely <unk> comments and thoughts poured in from across the world in that moment a few things occurred to me  one technology was always at hand for many young women like me  two like me most young women hardly use it to express their views <unk>  three <unk> i realized for the first time that my voice mattered <unk> so in the months that followed i covered a trail of events in bangalore which had no space in the mainstream news  in cubbon park which is a big park in bangalore <unk> i gathered with over one hundred others when groups of young men came forward to wear skirts to prove that clothing does not invite rape  when i reported about these <unk> felt i had charge i felt like i had a channel to release all the emotions i had inside me <unk>  i attended the town hall march when students held up signs saying kill them hang them  you wouldn 't do this to your mothers or sisters  i went to a candlelight vigil where citizens gathered together to talk about the issue of sexual violence openly <unk>  <unk> the reactions confused me <unk> while supportive comments poured in from across the world <unk> as did vicious ones <unk> so some called me a hypocrite some called me a victim a rape apologist some even said i had a political motive <unk>  but this one comment kind of describes <unk> what we are discussing here today <unk>  but i was soon to learn that this was not all  as empowered as i felt with the new liberty that this citizen journalism channel gave me <unk>  i found myself in an unfamiliar situation  so sometime last august i logged onto facebook and i was looking through my news feed and i noticed there was a link that was being shared by my friends <unk> i clicked on the <unk> it led me back to a report uploaded by an american girl called michaela cross <unk> the report was titled india <unk> the story you never wanted to hear  and in this report she recounted her firsthand account of facing sexual harassment in india <unk>  she wrote there is no way to prepare for the eyes the eyes that every day stared <unk> such entitlement at my body with no change of expression whether i met their gaze or not  walking to the fruit seller 's or the tailor 's i got stares so sharp that they sliced away bits of me piece by piece  she called india a traveler 's heaven and a woman 's hell <unk> she said she was stalked <unk> groped and masturbated at <unk> now late that evening the <unk> it was on news channels across the world everyone was discussing it it had over a million views a thousand comments and shares <unk>  and i found myself witnessing a very similar thing  the media was caught in this vicious cycle of opinion and outburst and no outcome whatsoever <unk>  so that night as i sat wondering how i should respond <unk> i found myself filled with doubt you see as a writer i approached this issue as an observer as an indian i felt embarrassment and disbelief  and as an activist i looked at it as a defender of rights <unk> but as a citizen journalist  i suddenly felt very vulnerable <unk>  i mean here she was a young woman was using a channel to talk about her experience just as i was and yet i felt unsettled <unk>  you see no one ever tells you that true empowerment comes from giving yourself the permission to think and act  empowerment is often made to sound as if it 's an ideal it 's a wonderful outcome when we talk about empowerment we often talk about giving people access to materials <unk> giving them access to tools <unk> but the thing is empowerment is an emotion it 's a feeling the first step to empowerment is to give yourself the authority <unk>  the key to independent will <unk> and for women everywhere no matter who we are or where we come from  that is the most difficult step  we fear the sound of our own voice for it means admission but it is this that gives us the power to change our environment <unk> this situation where i was faced with so many different kinds of realities <unk> i was unsure how to judge because i didn 't know what it would mean for me <unk>  i feared to judge because i didn 't know what it would be if i didn 't support the same view as this girl i didn 't know what it would mean for me if i <unk> i was challenging someone <unk> it was simple i had to make a decision should i speak up or should i stay quiet <unk>  so after a lot of thought  i recorded a video blog in response and i told michaela well there are different sides to india <unk> and i also <unk> <unk> tried to explain that things would be okay and i expressed my regret for what she had faced and a few days later <unk> i was invited to talk on <unk> air with her and for the first time i reached out to this girl who i had never met who was so far away <unk> but yet i felt so close to  since this report came to light <unk> more young people than ever were discussing sexual harassment on the campus <unk>  and the university that michaela belonged to gave her the assistance she needed <unk> the university even took measures to train its students to equip them with the skills that they need to confront challenges such as harassment <unk>  and for the first the time i felt i wasn 't alone  you see if there 's anything that i 've learned as an active citizen journalist <unk> over the past few years it is our dire lack as a society to actively find avenues where our voices can be heard  we don 't realize that when when we are standing up we are not just standing up as individuals <unk> we are standing up for our communities our friends our peers most of us say that women are denied their rights <unk> but the truth <unk> women deny themselves these rights in a recent survey in india ninety five percent of the women who work in i t aviation hospitality and call centers said they didn 't feel safe returning home alone after work in the late hours or in the evening  in bangalore where i come from this number is eighty five percent <unk> rural areas in india <unk>  if anything is to go by the recent gang rapes in badaun and acid attacks in odisha and aligarh are supposed to go by  we need to act really soon  don 't get me wrong the challenges that women will face in telling their stories is real <unk>  but we need to start pursuing and trying to identify mediums to participate in our system and not just pursue the media <unk> blindly  today <unk> more women than ever are standing up and questioning the government in india <unk> and this is a result of that courage  there is a sixfold increase in women reporting harassment and the government passed the criminal law act in two thousand and thirteen <unk> to protect women against sexual assault as i end this talk i just want to say that i know a lot of us in this room have our secrets <unk>  but let us speak up let us fight the shame and talk about it it could be a platform a community your loved one whoever or whatever you choose <unk> but let us speak up the truth is the end to this problem begins with us thank you
