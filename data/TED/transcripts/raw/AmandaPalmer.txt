 <unk> i didn 't always make my living from music for about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university this was my day job  i was a <unk> <unk> self employed living statue called the eight foot bride <unk> and i love telling people i did this for a job because everybody always wants to know who are these freaks in real <unk> life hello  i painted myself white one day <unk> stood on a box put a hat or a can at my feet and when someone came by and dropped in money <unk> i handed them a flower and some intense eye contact and if they didn 't take the <unk> i threw in a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away  so i had the most profound encounters with people especially lonely people who looked like they hadn 't talked to anyone in weeks <unk> and we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street <unk> and we <unk> would sort of fall in love a little bit and my eyes would say  thank you i see you and their eyes would say  nobody ever sees me thank you  i would get harassed sometimes people would <unk> but it hurt <unk> because it made me fear that i was somehow doing something and unfair <unk> shameful i had no idea how perfect a real education i was getting for the music business on this box <unk> for the economists out there you may be interested to know i actually made a pretty predictable income which was shocking to me given i had no regular customers but pretty much sixty bucks on a tuesday ninety bucks on a friday it was consistent  and meanwhile i was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band the dresden dolls this was me on piano a genius drummer <unk> i wrote the songs and eventually we started making enough money that i could quit being a statue <unk>  and as we started touring i really didn 't want to lose this sense of direct connection with people because i loved it so after all of our shows we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people  and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us and i would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows <unk> and they <unk> would pass the hat and then they would come in and join us onstage so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird random circus guests  and then twitter came along and made things even more magic because i could ask instantly for anything anywhere <unk> so i would need a piano to practice on and an hour later i would be at a fan 's house this is in london <unk> food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us this is in seattle  fans who worked in museums and stores and and any kind of public space would wave their hands if i would decide to do a last minute spontaneous free gig <unk> this is a library in auckland  on saturday i tweeted for this crate and hat because i did not want to schlep them from the east coast and they showed up care of this dude chris from newport beach <unk> who says hello <unk>  i once tweeted where in melbourne can i buy a neti pot  and a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe i was in and i bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death <unk>  and i love this kind of random closeness <unk> which is lucky <unk> because <unk> i do a lot of couchsurfing  in mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there 's no wireless <unk> and in punk squats <unk> everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with <unk> <unk> wireless <unk> clearly making it the better option  my crew once pulled our van up to a really poor miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was <unk> family were all undocumented immigrants from honduras and that night her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds <unk> and i lay there thinking  these people have so little is this fair <unk> and in the morning her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give <unk> me a bible and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken english your music has helped my daughter so much <unk> thank you for staying here <unk> we 're all so grateful and i thought <unk> this is fair <unk>  <unk> this is this  a couple of months later i was in manhattan <unk>  and i tweeted for a crash pad and at midnight i 'm on the lower east side and it occurs to me i 've never actually done this alone i 've always been with my band or my crew is this what stupid people do  is this how stupid people die <unk>  and before i can change my mind the door busts open she 's an artist he 's a financial blogger for reuters <unk> and they 're pouring me a glass of red wine and offering <unk> me a bath and i have had thousands of nights like that and like that  so i couchsurf a lot <unk> i also crowdsurf a lot <unk> i maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing you 're falling into the audience and you 're trusting each other <unk> i once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get <unk> extra money something that i did a lot <unk> and as usual the band was psyched but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn 't bring himself to go out there it felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat <unk> and i recognized his fear of is this fair <unk> bigger and bigger we sign with a major label <unk> and our music is a cross between punk and cabaret it 's not for everybody  well <unk> maybe it 's for you  we sign and there 's all this hype leading up to our next record and it comes out and it sells about twenty five thousand copies in the first <unk> the sales are going down it 's a failure and they walk off right at this same time <unk> i 'm signing and hugging after a gig <unk> and a guy comes up to me and hands me a $ ten bill and he says i 'm sorry i burned your cd from a friend <unk> know you hate your label i just want you to have this money and this starts happening all the time <unk> i become the hat after my own gigs but i have to physically stand there and take the help from people and unlike the guy in the opening band i 've actually had a lot of practice standing there  <unk> and this is the moment i decide i 'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible so it 's like metallica over here <unk>  napster <unk> bad amanda palmer over here <unk> and i 'm going to encourage torrenting downloading sharing <unk> but i 'm going to ask for help <unk> because i saw it work on the street <unk> so i fought my way off my label <unk> and for my next project with my new band the grand theft orchestra <unk> i turned to crowdfunding <unk>  and i fell into those thousands of connections that i 'd made <unk> and i asked my crowd to catch me  and the goal was one hundred thousand dollars my fans backed me at nearly one point two million which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date  and you can see how many <unk> people it is it 's about twenty five thousand people  and the media asked amanda the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy how did you make all these people pay for music  and the real answer is i didn 't make them  i asked them  and through the very act of asking <unk> connected with them <unk> and when you connect with them people want to help you it 's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists they don 't want to ask for things but it 's not easy it 's not easy to ask <unk> and a lot of artists have a problem with this asking makes you vulnerable <unk>  and i got a lot of criticism online after my kickstarter went big for <unk> continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer <unk> and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website <unk> and this hurt in a really familiar <unk> you 're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling get a job because they weren 't with us on the sidewalk <unk> and they couldn 't see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them <unk> this is slightly not safe for work this is my kickstarter backer party in berlin at the end of the night i stripped and let everyone draw on me <unk>  now let me tell you if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers  i recommend this <unk> especially if those strangers are drunk german people  this was a ninja <unk> <unk> because what i was really saying here was i trust you this much <unk> should i show me  for most of human history musicians artists they 've been part of the community <unk>  connectors and and openers not untouchable stars <unk> celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a <unk> the internet and the content that we 're freely able to share on it are taking us back it 's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough  so a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price they see it as an unpredictable risk but the things i 've done the kickstarter the street <unk> the doorbell <unk> i don 't see these things as risk <unk> i see them as trust <unk> now the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street <unk> they 're getting there <unk> but the perfect tools aren 't going to help us if we can 't face each other and give and receive fearlessly but more important to ask without shame my music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the internet the way i could on the box <unk>  so blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers our mistakes and we see each other <unk>  and i think when we really see each other <unk> want to help each other <unk>  i think people have been obsessed with the wrong question <unk> which is how do we make people pay for music  what if we started asking  how do we let people pay for music
