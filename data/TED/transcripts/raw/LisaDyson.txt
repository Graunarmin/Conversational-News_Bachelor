 <unk> a part of a crew of astronauts traveling to mars or some distant planet the travel time could take a year or even longer  the space on board and the resources would <unk> be limited <unk> so you and the crew would have to figure out how to produce food with minimal inputs  what if you could bring with you just a few packets of seeds <unk>  and grow crops in a matter of hours <unk> and what if those crops would then make more seeds <unk> enabling you to feed the entire crew with just those few packets of seeds for the duration of the trip  well <unk> the scientists at nasa actually figured out a way to do this  what they came up with was actually quite interesting it involved microorganisms which are <unk> single celled organisms <unk>  and they also used hydrogen from water  the types of microbes that they <unk> a virtuous carbon cycle that would sustain life onboard a spacecraft  astronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide that carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes and converted into a nutritious carbon rich crop the astronauts would then eat <unk> and exhale the carbon out in the form of carbon dioxide which would then be captured by the microbes to create a nutritious crop <unk> which then would be exhaled in the form of carbon dioxide by the astronauts  so in this way a closed loop carbon cycle is created <unk>  so why is this important  we need carbon to survive as humans <unk> and we get our carbon from food  on a long space journey you simply wouldn 't be able to pick up any carbon along the way <unk> so you 'd have to figure out how to recycle it on board  this is a clever solution <unk> right <unk>  but the thing is that research didn 't really go anywhere we haven 't yet gone to mars we haven 't yet gone to another planet <unk> and this was actually done in the ' 60s and ' 70s  so a colleague of mine dr john reed and <unk> were interested actually in carbon recycling here on earth <unk> we wanted to come up with technical solutions to address climate change <unk> and we discovered this research by reading some papers published in the <unk> and later articles about this work <unk> and we thought it was a really good idea <unk> so we said well earth is actually like a spaceship <unk>  we have limited space and limited resources and on earth we really do need to figure out <unk> how to recycle our carbon better <unk> so we had the idea can we take some of these nasa type ideas and apply them to our carbon problem here on earth <unk> could we cultivate these nasa type microbes in order to make valuable products here on earth <unk> we started a company to do it and in that company we discovered that these <unk> which i 'll actually call nature 's supercharged carbon recyclers we found that they are a powerful class of microbes that had been largely overlooked and understudied <unk> and that they could make some really valuable products so we began cultivating these products <unk> these microbes in our lab we found that we can make essential amino acids from carbon dioxide using these microbes  and we even made a protein rich meal that has an amino acid profile similar to what you might find in some animal proteins <unk> we began cultivating them even further <unk> and we found that we can make oil oils are used to manufacture many products <unk> we made an oil that was similar to a citrus oil <unk> which can be used for flavoring and for <unk> fragrances <unk> but it also can be used as a biodegradable cleaner or even as a jet fuel <unk>  and we made an oil that 's similar to palm oil palm oil is used to manufacture a wide range of consumer and industrial goods <unk> we began working with manufacturers to scale up this technology and we 're currently working with them to bring some of these products to market <unk> we believe this type of technology can indeed help us profitably recycle carbon dioxide into valuable products something that 's beneficial for the planet but also beneficial for business <unk> that 's what we 're doing today but tomorrow <unk> this type of technology and using these types of microbes actually could help us do something <unk> even greater if we take it to the next level <unk> we believe that this type of technology can actually help us address an issue with agriculture and allow us to create a type of agriculture that 's sustainable  that will allow us to scale to meet the demands of tomorrow <unk>  and why might we need a sustainable agriculture <unk>  well actually it is estimated that the population will reach about ten billion by two <unk> 're projecting that we will need to increase food production by seventy percent  in addition we will need many more resources and raw materials to make consumer goods and industrial goods <unk> so how will we scale to meet that demand well modern agriculture simply cannot sustainably scale to meet that demand <unk> <unk> are a number of reasons why one of them is that modern agriculture is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases  in fact it emits more greenhouse gases than our cars our trucks our planes and our trains combined <unk>  another reason is that modern ag simply takes up a whole lot of land <unk>  we have cleared nineteen point four million square miles for crops and <unk> livestock what does that look like well that 's roughly the size of south america and africa combined let me give you a specific example in indonesia  an amount of virgin rainforest was cleared totaling the size of approximately ireland <unk> between two thousand and two thousand and twelve just think of all of the species <unk> diversity that was removed in the process <unk> whether plant life insects or animal life and a natural carbon sink was also removed so let me make this real for you  this clearing happened primarily to make room for palm plantations <unk>  and as i mentioned before palm oil is used to manufacture many products in fact it is estimated that over fifty percent of consumer products are manufactured using palm oil <unk>  and that includes things like ice cream <unk> cookies  it includes cooking oils it also includes detergents <unk> lotions soaps <unk> you and i both probably have numerous items in our kitchens and our bathrooms that were manufactured using palm oil <unk> so you and i are direct beneficiaries of removed rainforests modern ag has some problems <unk> and we need solutions if we want to scale sustainably i believe that microbes can be a part of the answer specifically these supercharged carbon recyclers <unk> these supercharged carbon recyclers like plants serve as the natural recyclers in their ecosystems where they thrive <unk> and they thrive in exotic places on earth like hydrothermal vents and hot springs in those ecosystems they take carbon and recycle it into the nutrients needed for those ecosystems <unk>  and they 're rich in nutrients such as oils and proteins <unk> minerals and carbohydrates and actually <unk> microbes are already an integral part of our everyday lives if you enjoy a glass of pinot noir on a friday night after a long hard work week  then you are enjoying a product of microbes <unk>  if you enjoy a beer from your local microbrewery a product of microbes <unk> or bread <unk> or <unk> or yogurt these are all products of microbes <unk>  but the beauty and power associated with these supercharged carbon recyclers lies in the fact that they can actually produce in a matter of hours <unk> versus months that means we can make crops much faster they can grow in containers that require minimal space  and we can get to a type of vertical agriculture <unk> instead of our traditional horizontal agriculture that requires so much land we can scale vertically <unk>  and as a result produce much more product per area if we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recyclers then we wouldn 't have to remove any more rainforests to make the food and the goods that we consume <unk>  because at a large scale you can actually make ten thousand times more output per land area than you could for instance if you used soybeans if you planted soybeans on that same area of land over a period of a year ten thousand <unk> times over a period of a year <unk>  so this is what i mean by a new type of agriculture  and this is what i mean by developing a system that allows us to sustainably scale to meet the demands of ten billion  and what would be the products of this new type <unk> we 've already made a protein meal <unk> so you can imagine something similar to a soybean meal <unk> or even cornmeal or wheat flour <unk>  we 've already made oils <unk> so you can imagine something similar to coconut oil or olive oil or soybean oil <unk>  so this type of crop can actually produce the nutrients that would give us pasta and bread <unk> cakes nutritional items of many sorts is used to manufacture multiple other goods industrial products and consumer products you can imagine being able to make detergents soaps lotions <unk> etc using these types of crops not only are we running out of space  but if we continue to operate under the status quo with modern agriculture <unk> we run the risk of robbing our progeny <unk> of a beautiful planet but it doesn 't have to be this way <unk> we can imagine a future of abundance  let us create systems that keep planet earth our spaceship <unk> not only from not crashing  but let us also develop systems and ways of living that will be beneficial to the lives of ourselves and the ten billion that will be on this planet by two thousand and fifty <unk> thank you very much
