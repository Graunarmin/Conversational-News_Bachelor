 <unk> you know that all of the cool people are they 're doing it <unk> and you 're on the outside you 're at home you 're like the raspyni brothers where you 've got your <unk> got your balls in cold water <unk> and  you just play with your fingers all day and then you get invited and you 're on the inside <unk> and it 's everything you hoped it would be it 's exciting and there 's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it 's over  and it 's only taken five minutes <unk> and you want to go back and do it again <unk> but i really appreciate being here and <unk> thank you chris and also thank you deborah patton for making this possible <unk> so anyway today we 'll talk about architecture a little bit <unk> within the subject of creation and optimism and if you put creation and optimism together you 've got two choices that you can talk about you can talk about creationism which i think wouldn 't go down <unk> well with this audience at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it or you can talk about optimisations spelled the british way with an s <unk>  instead of a z and i think that 's what i 'd like to talk about today but any kind of conversation about architecture which is in fact what you were just talking about what was going on here setting up <unk> at the present time can 't really happen without a conversation about this  the world trade center <unk> and what 's been going on there what it means to us <unk> because if architecture is what i believe it to be which is the built form of our cultural ambitions <unk>  what do you do when presented with an opportunity to <unk> rectify a situation that represents somebody else 's cultural ambitions relative to us <unk> and our own opportunity <unk> <unk> to make something new there this has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time i think that the world trade center in <unk> rather an <unk> brought architecture into focus in a way that i don 't think people had thought of in a long time  and made it a subject for common conversation i don 't remember in my 20 year career of practicing and writing about architecture a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning  fire exiting safety concerns and whether carpet burns <unk> these are just not things we talked about very often and yet now <unk> it 's talked about all the time at the point where you <unk> can weaponize your buildings <unk>  you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way <unk> and so now we 're going to think about architecture in a very different way  we 're going to think about it like this how many of you saw usa today <unk> today <unk> there it is looks like that there 's the world trade center site on the front cover they 've made a selection they 've chosen a project by daniel libeskind the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture <unk> piano player he started on the squeezebox and moved to a little more serious issue a bigger instrument and now to an even larger instrument <unk> upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic as you see here <unk> he was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of new york was forced to go oh i 'm really sorry we screwed up  right can we do this again from the top except use some people with a vague hint of talent <unk> instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities let 's bring in <unk> real architects for a change <unk> and so we got this or we had a choice of that oh stop clapping  it 's too late that is gone this was a scheme by a team called think a new york based team <unk> and then there was that one which was the libeskind scheme this one <unk>  this is going to be the new world trade center <unk> a giant hole in the ground with big <unk> buildings falling into it now i don 't know what you think but i think this is a pretty stupid decision  because what you 've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever <unk>  but that 's what we 're going to do but i want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that american architecture represents and that these two things talk <unk> about very specifically <unk> and that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic <unk> solution to everything that there is a large technical answer that can solve all problems be they social be they physical be they <unk> or something that 's more of a romantic solution now i don 't mean romantic as in this is a nice place to take someone on a date <unk>  i mean romantic in the sense of there are things larger and grander than us so in the american tradition the difference between the technocratic and the romantic would be the difference between thomas jefferson 's cartesian grids spreading across the united states that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the united states as a <unk> really truly technocratic solution <unk> a bowing to the in jefferson 's time current popular philosophy of rationalism <unk> or the way we went to describe that later manifest destiny <unk> now which would you rather be a grid <unk> it sounds big it sounds important it sounds solid it sounds american ballsy serious <unk> male <unk>  and that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time i mean it goes on in our private lives too every single day we all want to go out and buy an <unk> an audi tt don 't we everyone here must own one or at least they craved one the moment they saw one <unk> and then they hopped in it turned the little electronic key <unk> rather than the real <unk> <unk> key <unk> zipped home on their new superhighway and drove straight into a garage that looks like a tudor castle  why <unk> why <unk> why do you want to do that why do we all want to do that i even <unk> in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger sort of more romantic image of where we are so we 're going to go straight into this can i have the lights off for a moment  i 'm going to talk about two architects very very briefly that represent the the current split architecturally <unk> between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution and these are two of the top architectural practices in the united states today one very young one a little more mature  this is the work of a firm called shop and what you 're seeing here their isometric drawings of what will be a large scale camera obscura in a public park does everybody know what a camera obscura is <unk> yeah <unk> it 's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world it 's sort of a little movie without any moving parts and projects it on a page and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it <unk> this is just the outline of it and you can see does it look like a regular building no it <unk> <unk> 's actually non orthogonal it 's not up and down square rectangular anything like that that you 'd see in a normal shape of a building the computer revolution the technocratic technological revolution has allowed us to <unk> traditionally shaped buildings in favor of non orthogonal buildings such as this <unk> what 's interesting about it is not the shape what 's interesting about it is how it 's made  how it 's made a brand new way to put buildings together something called mass customization no it is not an oxymoron what makes the building expensive in the traditional sense is making <unk> individual parts custom that you can 't do over and over again that 's why we all live in developer houses <unk> they all want to save money by building the same thing five hundred times  mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer a program that says <unk> manufacture these parts the computer then talks to a machine <unk> a computer operated machine a cad cam machine that can make a zillion different changes at a moment 's notice because the computer is just a machine it doesn 't care <unk> it 's manufacturing the parts <unk> it doesn 't see any excess cost it doesn 't spend any extra time <unk> it 's not a laborer it 's simply an electronic lathe so the parts can all be cut at the same time meanwhile <unk>  instead of sending someone working drawings which are those huge sets of blueprints that you 've seen your whole life what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions like you used to get when you were a child when you bought little models that <unk> and so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off site and delivered on a truck to the site to that builder and a set of these instruction <unk> <unk> manuals just simple bolt a to b and they will be able to put them together here 's the little drawing that tells them how that works these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of ps1 which is a museum in brooklyn new york as part of their young architects summer series and they said well it 's summer what do you do in the summer you go to the beach  and when you go to the beach <unk> what do you get you get sand dunes so let 's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana  <unk> out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune they took photographs they fed the photographs into their computer program and that computer program shaped a sand dune and <unk> <unk> then took that sand dune shape and turned it into at their instructions using standard software with slight modifications <unk> piece of wood to be cut all of which were delivered by flat bed on a truck and hand assembled in forty eight hours by a team of eight people only one of whom had ever seen the plans before  only one of whom had ever seen the plans before <unk> and here comes dune scape coming up out of the courtyard  and there it is fully built there are only sixteen different pieces of wood <unk> only sixteen different assembly parts here <unk>  looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside <unk> it has its own built in swimming pool  very very cool  it 's a great place for parties it was it was only up for six weeks <unk>  it 's got little dressing rooms and cabanas where lots of interesting things went on all summer long  now <unk> lest you think <unk> that this is only for the light at heart or just temporary installations this is the same firm working at the world trade center <unk> replacing the bridge that used to go across west street that very important pedestrian connection between the city of new york and the redevelopment of the west side they were asked to design <unk> replace that bridge in six weeks building it including all of the parts manufactured <unk>  and they were able to do it that was their design <unk> using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts a couple of struts like this some exterior cladding <unk> <unk> material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off site and delivered by truck <unk> they were able to create that  <unk> on the side of new york <unk> using the same technology here we 're going to walk across the bridge at night it 's self lit you don 't need any overhead lighting so the neighbors don 't complain about metal halide lighting in their face here it is going across  and there down the other side and you get the same kind of grandeur now let me show you quickly the opposite if i may  woo pretty huh this is the other side of the coin <unk> this is the work of david rockwell from new york city whose work you can see out here today the current king of the romantics <unk> who approaches his work in a very different fashion <unk> it 's not to create a technological solution <unk> it 's to seduce you into something that you can do <unk> into something that will please you something that will lift your spirits something that will make you feel as if are in another world such as his nobu restaurant in new york which is supposed to take you from the clutter of new york city <unk> simplicity of japan and the elegance of japanese tradition when it 's all said and done <unk> it 's got to look like seaweed said the owner <unk>  or his restaurant pod in philadelphia pennsylvania i want you to know the room you 're looking at is stark white <unk> every single surface of this restaurant is white  the reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting <unk> it 's all <unk> about sensuality <unk> it 's all about transforming watch this i 'm not touching any buttons ladies and gentlemen <unk> this is happening by itself  it transforms through the magic of lighting <unk> it 's all about sensuality it 's all about touch rosa mexicano restaurant where he transports us to the shores of acapulco <unk> up on the upper west side with this wall of cliff divers <unk> like that let 's see it one more time <unk> okay just to make sure that you 've enjoyed it <unk>  and finally it 's about comfort <unk> it 's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn 't have felt good before it 's about bringing nature to the inside
