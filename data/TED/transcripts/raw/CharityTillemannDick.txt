 <unk> are celebrating an anniversary with me i 'm not married <unk> six years before that i was starting my career as an opera singer in europe  when i was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension also known as ph it happens when there <unk> a thickening in the pulmonary veins making the right side of the heart work overtime and causing what i call the <unk> effect my heart was three and a half sizes too big <unk> physical activity becomes very difficult for people with <unk> and usually after two to five years you die <unk>  i went to see this specialist and she was top of the field and told me i had to stop singing  she said those high notes are going to kill you  while she didn 't have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary <unk> she was absolutely emphatic i was singing my own obituary <unk>  i was very limited by my condition physically <unk>  but i was not limited when i sang <unk> and as air came up from my lungs through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound <unk> it was the closest thing i had ever come <unk> and just because of someone 's hunch i wasn 't going to give it up <unk>  thankfully <unk> i met reda girgis who is dry as toast but he and his team at johns hopkins didn 't just want me to survive they wanted me to live a meaningful life this meant making trade offs  i come from colorado it 's a mile high and i grew up there with ten brothers and sisters and two adoring parents well the altitude exacerbated my symptoms  so i moved to baltimore to be near my doctors and enrolled in a conservatory nearby <unk> i couldn 't walk as much as i used to so i opted for five inch heels and i gave up <unk> i started taking huge doses of sildenafil <unk> also known as viagra  my father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for ph but after six <unk> i couldn 't walk up a small hill <unk> i couldn 't climb a flight of stairs i could barely stand up without feeling like i was going to faint <unk>  i had a heart catheterization where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure <unk> which is supposed to be between fifteen and twenty <unk> mine was one hundred and forty six i like to do things big <unk>  and it meant one thing there is a big gun treatment for pulmonary hypertension called flolan <unk> and it 's not just a drug <unk> it 's a way of life doctors insert a catheter into your chest  which is attached to a pump that weighs about <unk> four and a half pounds  every day twenty four hours that pump is at your side administering medicine directly to your heart and it 's not a particularly <unk> preferable medicine in many senses <unk> this is a list of the side effects if you eat too much salt  like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you 'll probably end up in the icu if you go through a metal detector you 'll probably die <unk> if you get a bubble in your medicine because you have to mix it every morning and it stays in there you probably die <unk> die <unk> if you run out of medicine you definitely die <unk> no one wants to go on flolan <unk> but when i needed it it was a godsend <unk>  within a few days i could walk again <unk> within a few weeks i was performing <unk> and in a few months <unk> i debuted at the kennedy center  was a little bit problematic when performing so i 'd attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ace bandage <unk> literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my spanx hoping the doors wouldn 't open unexpectedly and the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume <unk> designers <unk>  i graduated from graduate school in two thousand and six  and i got a fellowship to go back to europe  a few days after arriving i met this wonderful old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles and before long i was commuting between budapest milan and florence <unk>  though i was attached to this ugly <unk> my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera very complicated but in a good way <unk> then in february of two thousand and eight my grandfather passed away <unk> he was a big figure in all of our lives and we loved him very much it certainly didn 't prepare me for what came next <unk> weeks later i got a call from my family my father had been in a catastrophic car accident <unk> and he died  at twenty four my death would have been entirely expected <unk> but his well the only way i can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my <unk> medical decline <unk>  against my doctors ' and family 's wishes i needed to go back for the funeral <unk> i had to say goodbye in some way shape or form <unk>  but soon i was showing signs of right heart failure <unk> and i had to return to sea level doing so knowing that i probably would never <unk> canceled most of my engagements that summer but i had one left in tel aviv so i went  after one performance <unk> i could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxicab <unk> i sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face <unk> and in the heat of the desert <unk> i was freezing cold my fingers started turning blue <unk> and i was like is going on here i heard my heart 's valves snapping open and closed the cab stopped and i pulled my body from it feeling <unk> <unk> each ounce of weight as i walked to the elevator <unk> i fell through my apartment door and crawled to the bathroom <unk> dying <unk> and if i didn 't mix that stuff up fast <unk> i would never leave that apartment alive <unk>  i started mixing and i felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another <unk> but i just kept on going finally with the last bottle in and the last bubble out i attached the pump to the tubing and lay there hoping it would kick in <unk> soon enough if it didn 't i 'd probably see my father sooner than i anticipated <unk>  thankfully  in a few minutes i saw the signature hive like rash appear on my legs <unk>  which is a side effect of the medication and i knew i 'd be okay we 're not big on fear in my family <unk>  but i was scared  i went back to the states anticipating i 'd return to europe <unk> but the heart catheterization showed that wasn 't going anywhere further that a flight for life from johns hopkins hospital i performed here and there but as my condition deteriorated so did my voice  my doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant <unk> i didn 't <unk>  i had two friends who had recently died months after having very challenging surgeries i knew another young man though who had ph who died while waiting <unk> for one i wanted to live i thought stem cells were a good option <unk> but they hadn 't developed to a point where i could take advantage of them yet  i officially took a break from singing <unk> and i went to the cleveland clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years for transplant <unk> i was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking with the head transplant surgeon and i asked him if i needed a transplant <unk> what i could do to prepare  he said be happy a happy patient is a healthy patient  it was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and <unk> i still didn 't want a transplant but in a month <unk> i was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles very attractive <unk> and it was right heart failure <unk> i finally decided it was time to take my doctor 's advice <unk> it was time for me to go to cleveland and to start the agonizing wait <unk> for a match <unk>  but the next morning <unk>  while i was still in the hospital <unk> i got a telephone call it was my doctor in cleveland marie budev  and they had lungs <unk> it was a match they were from texas <unk> and everybody was really happy for me <unk> problems i had spent my whole life training my lungs and i was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up i flew to cleveland  and my family rushed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye <unk>  but organs <unk> and i went into surgery before i could say goodbye  the last thing i remember was lying on a white blanket <unk> telling my surgeon that i needed to see my mother again <unk>  and to please try and save my voice <unk> i fell into this apocalyptic dream world during the <unk> blood were infused into my body <unk>  and in my surgeon 's 20 year career he said it was among the most difficult transplants that he 's ever performed  they left my chest open for two weeks you could see my over sized heart beating inside of it i was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive infection ravaged my skin <unk> i had hoped my voice would be saved but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it if they stayed in there was no way i would ever sing again <unk> so <unk> the top guy at the clinic to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box  he said it would kill me so my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last ditch attempt to save my voice <unk> though my mom couldn 't say goodbye to me before the surgery she didn 't leave my side in the months of recovery that followed <unk>  and if you want an example <unk> example of perseverance <unk> grit and strength in a beautiful little package <unk> it is her  one year ago to this very day <unk> i woke up i was <unk> there were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body <unk> i couldn 't walk <unk> i couldn 't talk i couldn 't eat <unk> i couldn 't move i certainly couldn 't sing <unk>  i couldn 't even breathe <unk>  but when i looked up and i saw my mother <unk>  i couldn 't help but smile <unk> whether by a mack truck or by heart failure or <unk> faulty lungs death happens <unk> but life isn 't really just about avoiding death is it it 's about living <unk>  medical conditions don 't negate the human condition <unk> and when people are allowed to pursue their passions doctors will find they have better happier and healthier patients my parents were totally stressed out <unk> about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time and i 'm so grateful they did this past summer <unk> when i was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the colorado rockies <unk>  i couldn 't help but think of that <unk> doctor who told me that i couldn 't sing <unk> and i wanted to tell her <unk> and i want to tell you we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams when we do we will find that patients don <unk> and some of us might even sing
