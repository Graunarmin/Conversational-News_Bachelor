 <unk> who are these people  it was an innocent question from my young daughter alia around the time when she was three  we were walking along with my husband in one of abu dhabi 's big fancy malls <unk>  <unk> was peering at a huge poster standing tall in the middle of the mall it featured the three rulers of the united arab emirates  as she tucked in my side i bent down and explained that these were the rulers of the uae who had worked hard to develop their nation and preserve its unity  she asked mom <unk> why is it that here where we live <unk> and back in lebanon <unk> where grandma and grandpa live  we never see the pictures of powerful women on the walls is it because women are not important this is probably the hardest question i 've had to answer in my years as a parent and in my 16 plus years of professional life for that matter <unk>  i had grown up in my hometown in lebanon <unk> the younger of two daughters to a very hard working pilot and director of operations for the lebanese <unk> i to pursue our education even though our culture emphasized at the time that it was sons and not daughters who should be professionally motivated <unk>  i was one of very few girls of my generation who left home at eighteen to study abroad  my father didn 't have a son <unk> and so i in a sense <unk> a couple of decades <unk> and i hope i didn 't do too badly in making my father proud of his would be son  as i got my bachelor 's and phd in electrical engineering did r & d in the uk then consulting in the middle east <unk>  i have always been in male dominated environments <unk>  truth be told <unk> i have never found a role model i could truly identify with  my mother 's generation wasn 't into professional leadership <unk> there were some encouraging men along the way <unk> but none knew the demands and pressures i was facing <unk>  pressures that got particularly acute when i had my own two beautiful children  and although western women love to give us poor <unk> oppressed arab women advice <unk>  they live different lives with different constraints <unk>  so arab women of my generation have had to become our own role models we have had to juggle more than arab men and we have had to face more cultural rigidity than western women  as a result <unk> i would like to think that we poor oppressed women actually have some useful certainly <unk> hard earned lessons to share <unk>  lessons that might turn out useful for anyone wishing to thrive in the modern world <unk> <unk> there is this word that everybody is touting as the key to success <unk> resilience well what exactly is resilience <unk> and how do you develop it  i believe resilience is simply the ability to transform shit into fuel  in my previous job <unk> well before my current firm <unk> i was working with a man we will call john  i had teamed up with john and was working hard hoping he would notice how great i was and that he would come to support my case to make partner at the firm <unk>  i was in addition to delivering on my consulting projects <unk> writing passionately on the topic of women economic empowerment  one day <unk> i got to present my research to a roomful of john was part of the audience listening for the first time to the details of my study  as i proceeded with my presentation i could see john in the corner of my eye  he had turned a dark shade of pink and had slid under his chair in apparent shame <unk>  i finished my presentation to an applauding audience and we rushed out and jumped into the car there he exploded what you did up there was unacceptable you are a consultant not an activist  i said john <unk> i don 't understand  i presented a couple of gender parity indices <unk>  and some conclusions about the arab world <unk> yes we do happen to be today at the bottom of the index but what is it that i said or presented that <unk> to which he replied the whole premise of your study is wrong what you are doing is dangerous and will break the social fabric of our society  he paused then added when women have children their place is in the home  time stood still for a long while and all i could think and repeat in the chaos of my brain was you can forget <unk> 's just never going to happen  it took me a couple of days to fully absorb this incident and its implications <unk> but once i did i reached three conclusions  one that these were his issues his complexes <unk> there may be many like him in our society but i would never let their issues become mine  two that i needed another sponsor and fast <unk> i got one by the way and boy was he great  and three that i would get to show john what women with children can do  i apply this lesson equally well to my personal life as i have progressed in my career <unk> i have received many words of encouragement <unk>  but i have also often been met by women men and couples who have clearly had an issue with my husband and i having chosen the path of a dual career couple <unk> so you get this well meaning couple who tells you straight out at a family gathering or at a friends gathering that come on you must know you 're not a great mom given how much you 're investing in your career right  i would lie if i said these words didn 't hurt  my children are the most precious thing to me and the thought that i could be failing them in any way is intolerable <unk>  but just like i did with john i quickly reminded myself that these were their issues their complexes <unk> so instead <unk> of replying <unk> i gave back one of my largest smiles as i saw in flashing light <unk> the following sign in my mind 's eye [ be happy it drives people crazy ]  you see as a young woman in these situations you have two options you can either decide to internalize <unk> these negative messages that are being thrown at you to let them make you feel like a failure like success is way too hard to ever achieve  or you can choose to see that others ' negativity is their own issue <unk> and instead transform it into your own personal fuel <unk>  i have learned to always go for option two and i have found that it has taken me from strength to strength and it 's true what they say success is the best <unk> some women in the middle east are lucky enough to be married to someone supportive of their career <unk>  correction i should say smart enough because who you marry is your own choice and you 'd better marry someone supportive if you plan to have a long career <unk>  still today the arab man is not an equal contributor in the home <unk> it 's simply not expected by our society <unk> and even frowned upon as not very manly <unk> as for the arab woman our society still assumes that her primary source of happiness should be the happiness and prosperity of her children and husband <unk>  she mostly exists for her family <unk>  things are changing <unk> but it will take time for now it means that the professional arab woman has to somehow maintain the perfect home  make sure that her children 's every need is being taken care of <unk> manage her demanding career  to achieve this i have found the hard way that you need to apply your hard earned professional skills to your personal life <unk>  you need to work your life <unk>  here is how i do this in my personal life <unk>  one thing to know about the middle east is that nearly every family has access to affordable domestic help <unk>  the challenge therefore becomes how to recruit effectively just like i would in my business life <unk> i have based the selection of who would support me with my children while i 'm at work on a strong referral <unk> cristina had worked for four years with my sister and the quality of her work was well established  she is now an integral member of our family having been with us since alia was six months old  she makes sure that the house is running smoothly while i 'm at work and i make sure to empower her <unk> optimal conditions for her and my children <unk> just like i would my best talent at work  this lesson applies whatever your childcare situation <unk>  whether an au pair <unk> nursery part time nanny that you share with someone else choose very carefully <unk>  and empower  if you look at my calendar you will see <unk> this is sacred time i have done this ever since alia was a baby  i do everything in my power to protect this time so that i can be home by then to spend quality time with my children asking them about their day <unk>  checking up on homework <unk> reading them a bedtime story and giving them lots <unk> of kisses and cuddles if i 'm traveling in whatever the time zone i use skype to connect with my children even if i am miles away  our son burhan is five years old <unk> and he 's learning to read and do basic maths <unk>  here 's another confession <unk> i have found that our daughter is actually more successful at teaching him these skills than i am  laughter it started as a game  <unk> to her little brother <unk> and i have found that these sessions actually improve burhan 's literacy <unk>  increase alia 's sense of responsibility and strengthen the bonding between them a win win all around  the successful arab women i know have each found their unique approach to working their life as they continue to shoulder the lion 's share of responsibility in the home  but this is not just about surviving in your dual role as a career woman and mother this is also <unk> about being in the present  when i am with my children  i try to leave work out of our lives instead of worrying about how many minutes i can spend with them every day i focus on turning these minutes into memorable moments moments where i 'm seeing my kids <unk> hearing them connecting with them [ join forces don 't compete ] arab women of my generation have not been very visible in the public eye as they <unk> grew up this explains i think to some extent why you find so few women in politics in the arab world <unk> the upside of this however is that we have spent a lot of time developing a social skill behind the scenes  in coffee shops in living rooms on the phone a social skill that is very important to success <unk>  <unk> i would say the average arab woman has a large network of friends and acquaintances <unk> the majority of those are also women  in the west <unk> it seems like ambitious women often compare themselves to other women hoping to be noticed as the most successful woman in the room this leads to the <unk> <unk> competitive behavior between professional women if there 's only room for one woman at the top then you can 't make room for others <unk> much less lift them up  arab women generally <unk> speaking have not fallen for this psychological trap <unk> faced with a patriarchal society they have found that by helping each other out <unk> all benefit  in my previous job <unk> i was the most senior woman in the middle east <unk> so one could think that investing in my network of female colleagues couldn 't bring many benefits and that i should instead invest my time developing my relationships with male seniors and peers two of my biggest breaks came through the support of other women  it was the head of marketing who initially suggested i be considered as a young global leader to the world economic forum <unk>  she was familiar with my media engagements and my publications and when she was asked to voice her opinion she highlighted my name  it was a young consultant a saudi lady and friend  <unk> who helped me sell my first project in saudi arabia a market i was finding hard to gain traction in as a woman  she introduced me to a client and that introduction led to the first of very many projects for me in saudi  today <unk> i have two senior women on my team <unk> and i see making them successful as key to my own success  women continue to advance in the world <unk> not fast enough <unk> but we 're moving the <unk> is making progress despite many recent setbacks  just this year <unk> the uae appointed five new female ministers to its cabinet for a total of eight female ministers  that 's nearly twenty eight percent of the cabinet <unk> and more than many developed countries can claim  this is today my daughter alia 's favorite picture  this is the result no doubt of great leadership <unk> but it is also the result of strong arab women not giving up and continuously pushing the boundaries  it is the result <unk> arab women deciding every day like me to convert shit into fuel to work their life to keep work out of their life <unk> and to join forces and not compete <unk>  as i look to the future my hopes for my daughter when she stands on this stage some twenty thirty years from now are that she be as proud to call herself her mother 's daughter as her father 's daughter  my hopes for my son are that by then the expression her mother 's son <unk> or mama 's boy would have taken on a completely different meaning thank you
