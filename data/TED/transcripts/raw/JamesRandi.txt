 <unk> see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces i <unk> <unk> very peculiar background attitude and <unk> to the real world because i am a conjurer now i prefer that term over magician because if i were a magician that would mean that i use spells and incantations and weird gestures in order to accomplish real magic no i don 't do that i 'm a conjurer who is someone who pretends to be a real magician  <unk> how do we go about that sort of thing we depend on the fact that audiences such as yourselves will make assumptions for example when i walked up here and i took the microphone from the stand and switched it on you assumed this was a microphone which it is not  as a matter of fact this is something that about half of you more than half of you will not be familiar with it 's a <unk> makes a very bad microphone i 've tried it many times  the other assumption that you made and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions not only that you can but that you will when they are properly suggested to you  you believe i 'm looking at you <unk>  wrong <unk> i 'm not looking at you i can 't see you <unk> i know you 're out there they told me backstage it 's a full house and such i know you 're there because i can hear you <unk> but i can 't see you because i normally wear glasses these are not glasses <unk> these are empty frames  quite empty frames now why would a grown man appear before you wearing empty frames on his face  to fool you ladies and gentlemen to deceive you to show that you too can make assumptions <unk> don 't you ever forget that  now i have to do something first of all switch to real glasses so i can actually see you which would probably be a convenience i don 't know i haven 't had a good look well <unk> that great a convenience  i have to do something now which seems a little bit strange for a magician <unk> but i 'm going to take some medication this is a full bottle of calms forte i 'll explain that in just a moment <unk> ignore the instructions that 's what the government has to put in there <unk> a moment i must tell you that i am an actor i 'm an actor who plays a specific part i play the part of a magician <unk> wizard if you will a real wizard if someone were to appear on this stage in front of me and actually claim to be an ancient prince of denmark named hamlet you would be insulted and rightly so why would a man assume that you would believe something bizarre like this but there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you <unk> that they have psychic <unk> magical powers that they can predict the future that they can make contact with with the deceased <unk> oh they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods oh they gladly sell you that <unk> yes <unk> and they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machines and free energy systems <unk> they claim to be psychics or sensitives whatever they can <unk> thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead  now to my innocent mind dead implies incapable of communicating  you might agree with me on that <unk> but these people <unk> they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead but they can hear the dead as well and they can relay this information back to the living  i wonder if that 's true <unk>  i don 't think so because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do exactly the same the same physical methods the same psychological methods and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth to their detriment <unk> they deceive these people costs them a lot of money cost them a lot of emotional anguish <unk>  billions of dollars are spent every year all over the globe on these charlatans <unk>  now <unk> i have two questions i would like to ask these people if i had the opportunity to do <unk> first question if i want to ask them to call up because they do hear them through the ear they listen to the spirits like this i 'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because when she died she had the family will and she secreted it someplace we don 't know where it is so we ask granny where is the will <unk> granny what does granny say <unk> she says i 'm in heaven and it 's wonderful i 'm here with all my old friends my deceased friends and my family and all the puppy dogs and the the kittens that i used to have when i was a little girl <unk> and i love you <unk> always be with you good bye  and she didn 't answer the damn question <unk>  where is the will  now she could easily have said oh it 's in the library on the second shelf behind the encyclopedia but she doesn 't say that <unk> no she doesn 't she doesn 't bring any useful information to us <unk> we paid a lot of money for that information be we didn 't get it  the second question that i 'd like to ask rather simple <unk> i ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased <unk> father in law as an example <unk> why do they insist on saying remember they speak into this ear why do they say my name starts with j or m  is this a hunting game hunting and fishing what is it is it twenty questions no it 's more like one hundred and <unk> game that these people play <unk> and they take advantage of the innocent the naive the grieving <unk> the needy people out there  now this is a process that is called cold reading  there 's one fellow out there <unk> van praagh is his name james van praagh he 's one of the <unk> practitioners of this sort of thing <unk> john edward sylvia browne and rosemary altea they are other operators there are hundreds of them all over the earth <unk> but in this country james <unk> <unk> van praagh is very big and what does he do <unk> he likes to tell you how the deceased got deceased <unk>  <unk> very often is like this he says he tells me <unk> he tells me before he passed <unk>  that he had trouble breathing folks <unk> that 's what dying is all about  you stop breathing and then you 're dead it 's that simple and that 's the kind of information they 're going to bring back to you <unk> i don 't think so now these people will make guesses they 'll say things like why am i getting electricity <unk> it was a game of hunting questions like this this is what they go through now  folks often ask us at the james randi educational foundation they call me they say why are you so concerned about this mr randi isn 't it just a lot of fun no it is not fun <unk> it is a cruel farce <unk>  now <unk> it may bring a certain amount of comfort  but that comfort lasts only about twenty minutes or so and then the people look in the mirror and they say <unk> i just paid a lot of money for that reading <unk> and what did she say to me ' i love <unk> <unk> you ' they always say that they don 't get any information they don 't get any value for what they spend <unk> now <unk> sylvia browne is the big operator we call her the talons  <unk> browne just to show you she actually gets seven hundred dollars for a twenty minute reading over the telephone she doesn 't even go there in person <unk> and you have to wait up to two years because she <unk> <unk> 's booked ahead that amount of time <unk> you pay by credit card or whatever <unk> and then she <unk> now <unk>  montel williams is an intelligent man <unk> we all know who he is on television he 's well educated <unk> he 's smart <unk> he knows what sylvia browne is doing but he doesn 't give a damn  he just doesn 't care  because the bottom line is the sponsors love it <unk> and he will expose her to television publicity all the time now what does sylvia browne <unk> give you for that seven hundred dollars she gives you the names of your guardian angels that 's first <unk> now <unk> without that how could we possibly function  she gives you the names of previous lives who you were in previous lives duh it turns out that the women that she gives readings for were all babylonian <unk> the men were all grecian warriors fighting with agamemnon <unk> nothing is ever said about a fourteen year old bootblack in the streets of london who died of consumption he isn 't worth bringing back obviously and the strange thing folks you may have noticed this too <unk> you see these folks on television they never call anybody back from hell <unk> everyone comes back from heaven but never from hell <unk> if they call back any of my friends they 're not going to well <unk> you see the story  now <unk> sylvia browne is an exception  an exception in one way because the james randi educational foundation my foundation offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds very simply won all you have to do is prove any paranormal occult or supernatural event or power of any kind under proper observing conditions <unk> 's very easy win the million dollars sylvia browne is an exception in that she 's the only professional psychic in the whole world that has accepted our challenge <unk> she did this on the larry king live show on cnn six and a half years ago <unk> and we haven 't heard from her since  <unk> she said that first of all that she didn 't know how to contact me duh a professional psychic who speaks to dead people she can 't reach me  i 'm alive you may have noticed  well pretty well anyway <unk> she couldn 't reach me now she says she doesn 't want to reach me because i 'm a godless person all the more reason to take the million dollars wouldn 't you think sylvia now these people need to be stopped <unk> seriously now they need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce <unk> we get people coming to the foundation all the time <unk>  they 're ruined financially and emotionally because they 've given their money and their faith to these people  now i popped some pills earlier <unk> i have to explain that to you <unk>  homeopathy <unk> let 's find out what that 's all about <unk> it 's an alternative form of healing right homeopathy actually consists and that 's what this is this is calms forte thirty two caplets of sleeping pills i forgot to tell you that i just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills  six and a half days that certainly is a fatal dose it says right on the back <unk> case of overdose contact your poison control center immediately and it gives an eight hundred number <unk> keep your seats it 's going to be okay <unk> i don 't really need it because i 've been doing this stunt for audiences all over the world for the last eight or ten years taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills <unk> why don 't they affect me <unk> homeopathy <unk> it 's taking a medicine that really works and diluting it down well beyond avogadro 's limit diluting it down to the point where there 's none of it left  now folks this is not just a metaphor i 'm going to give you now <unk> it 's true <unk> it 's exactly equivalent to taking one <unk> of lake tahoe <unk> and then stirring it up obviously with a very big stick <unk>  and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous  then when you get a headache <unk> you take a sip of this water and voila <unk> it is gone laughter now that is true <unk> that is what homeopathy is all about and another claim that they make you 'll love this one the more dilute the medicine is they say <unk> more powerful it is  now wait a minute we heard about a guy in florida the poor man <unk> he was on homeopathic medicine he died of an overdose <unk> he forgot to take his pill  work on it work on it  it 's a ridiculous thing it is absolutely ridiculous <unk> i don 't know what we 're doing believing in all this nonsense over all these years <unk> now <unk> let me tell you the james randi educational foundation is waving this very big carrot <unk>  but i must say <unk> the fact that nobody has taken us up on this offer doesn 't mean that the powers don 't exist <unk>  they might some place out there  maybe these people are just independently wealthy well with sylvia <unk> seven hundred dollars for a twenty minute reading over the telephone that 's more than lawyers make  i mean that 's a fabulous amount of money these people don 't need the million dollars perhaps <unk> but wouldn 't you think they 'd like to take it just to make me look silly  just to get rid of this godless person out there that sylvia browne talks about all the time <unk> i think that something needs to be done about <unk> we really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal state and local authorities to get them to do something  if you find out now i understand <unk> we 've seen people even today speaking to us about aids epidemics and and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with those are very important  critically important to us and we must do something about those problems <unk> but at the same time as arthur c clarke said the rotting of the human mind <unk>  the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult and the supernatural all of this total nonsense this medieval thinking i think something should be done about that <unk> and it all lies in education  largely <unk> it 's the media who are to blame for <unk> they shamelessly promote all kinds of nonsense of this sort because it pleases the sponsors <unk> it 's the bottom line <unk> the dollar line <unk> that 's what they 're looking at  we really must do something about this i 'm willing to take your suggestions and i 'm willing to have you tune in to our webpage <unk>  it 's go in there and look at the archives and you will begin to understand much more of what i 've been talking you will see the records that we have there 's nothing like sitting in that library and having a family appear there and say that mum gave away all the family fortune she cashed in the cds <unk> she gave away the stocks and the certificates <unk>  that 's really sad to hear and it hasn 't helped them one bit <unk> hasn 't solved any of their problems <unk> yes there could be a rotting of the american mind and of <unk> minds all the way around the earth <unk> if we don 't start to think sensibly about these things <unk>  now <unk> we 've offered this carrot as i say we 've dangled the carrot <unk> we 're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it oh we get lots of them hundreds of them every year come by <unk> these are dowsers and people who think that they can talk to the dead as well but they 're amateurs <unk> they don 't know how to evaluate their own <unk> professionals never come near us <unk> except in that case of sylvia browne that i told you about a moment ago <unk> she did accept and then backed away <unk> ladies and gentlemen <unk> i 'm james randi <unk>  and i 'm waiting
