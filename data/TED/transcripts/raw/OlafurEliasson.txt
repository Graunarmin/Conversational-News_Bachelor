 <unk> have a studio in berlin let me cue on here which is down there in this snow just last weekend  in the studio we do a lot of experiments <unk> i would consider the studio more like a laboratory i have occasional meetings with scientists and i have an academy <unk> part of the university of fine arts in berlin we have an annual gathering of people and that is called life in space <unk> life in space is really not necessarily about how we do things but why we do things  do you mind looking with me at that little cross in the center there <unk> so just keep looking don 't mind me <unk> so you will have a yellow circle and we will do an <unk> goes away you will have another color the complementary color i am saying something and your eyes and your brain are saying something back  this whole idea of sharing the idea of constituting reality by overlapping what i say and what you say think of a movie since two years now with some stipends from the science ministry in berlin i 've been working on these films where we produce the <unk> film together <unk>  i don 't necessarily think the film is so interesting obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative but nevertheless what the potential is and just keep looking there what the potential is obviously is to kind of move the border of who is the author <unk>  and who is the receiver who is the consumer if you want and who has responsibility for what one sees <unk>  i think there is a socializing dimension in kind of moving that border who decides what reality is  this is the tate modern in london <unk>  the show was in a sense about that it was about a space in which i put half a semi circular yellow disk i also put a mirror in the ceiling and some fog some haze <unk> and my idea was to make the space tangible <unk> with such a big space the problem is obviously that discrepancy between what your body can embrace and what the space in that sense is so here i had the hope that by inserting some natural elements if you want some fog <unk> i could make the space tangible <unk> and what happens is that people they start to see themselves in this space so look at this look at the girl of course they have to look through a bloody camera in a museum <unk> museums are working today but look at her face there as she 's checking out looking at herself in the mirror oh <unk> that was my foot there she wasn 't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not  and in that whole idea  how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space how do we reconfigure it how do we know that being in a space makes a difference do you see when i said in the beginning it 's about why rather than how the why <unk> really what consequences does it have when i take a step what does it matter does it matter if i am in the world or not and does it matter whether the kind of actions i take filter into a sense of responsibility is art about that i would say yes <unk> it is obviously about not just about decorating the world and making it look even better or even worse if you ask me it also about taking responsibility like i did here when throwing some green dye in the river in l a stockholm <unk> norway and tokyo <unk>  among other places the green dye is not environmentally dangerous but it obviously looks really rather frightening and it 's on the other side also i think quite beautiful as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas in these different places of the world <unk> green river as a kind of activist idea not a part of an exhibition it was really about showing people <unk> in this city as they walk by that space has dimensions a space has time and the water flows through the city with time <unk> the water has an ability to <unk> make the city negotiable tangible <unk>  negotiable meaning that it makes a difference whether you do something or not it makes a difference whether you say i 'm a part of this city and if i vote it makes a difference if i take a stand it makes a difference this whole idea of a city not being a picture is i think something that art in a sense <unk> always was working with the idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship between what it means to be in a picture and what it means to be in a space <unk> what is the difference difference between thinking and doing <unk>  so these are different experiments with that i won 't go into them <unk> iceland <unk> lower right corner my favorite place  these kinds of experiments they filter into architectural models these are ongoing experiments <unk> one is an experiment i did for bmw an attempt to make a car it 's made out of ice <unk> a crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top which i am trying to turn into a concert hall in iceland a sort of a run track or a walk track on the top of a museum in denmark which is made of colored glass <unk> going all around so the movement with your legs will change the color of your horizon <unk> and two summers <unk> at the hyde park in london with the serpentine gallery a kind of a temporal pavilion where moving was the only way you could see the pavilion  this summer in new york there is one thing about falling water which is very much about the time it takes for water to fall <unk> it 's quite simple and fundamental <unk> i 've walked <unk> <unk> a lot in the mountains in iceland and as you come to a new valley as you come to a new landscape you have a certain view <unk> if you stand <unk> what you 're looking at the moment you start to move the mountain starts to move the big mountains far away they move less the small mountains in the foreground they move more <unk> and if you stop again you wonder is that a <unk> <unk> or is that a three hour hike or is that a whole day i 'm looking at if you have a waterfall in there <unk> right out there at the <unk> you look at the waterfall and you go oh the water is falling really slowly and you go my god it 's really far away and it 's a giant waterfall if a waterfall is falling faster <unk> it 's a smaller waterfall which is closer by because the speed of falling water is pretty constant everywhere and your body somehow knows that so this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space of course being an iconic city like new york <unk> had an interest in somehow playing around with the sense of space you could say that new york wants to seem as big as possible adding a measurement to that is interesting the falling water suddenly gives you a sense of oh <unk> brooklyn is exactly this much the distance between brooklyn and manhattan in this case the lower east river is this big so it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities it was also about giving the city a sense of <unk> dimension and why would we want to do that because i think it makes a difference whether you have a body that feels a part of a space rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture and ha ha there is a picture and here is i and what does it matter  is there a sense of consequences so if i have a sense of the space if i feel that the space is tangible <unk> if i feel there is time if there is a dimension i could call time <unk> i also feel that i can change the space <unk> and suddenly it makes a difference in terms of making space accessible <unk> one could say this is about community collectivity it 's about being together <unk> how do we create create public space what does the word public mean today anyway  so asked in that <unk> i think it raises great things about parliamentary ideas democracy public space <unk> being together being individual <unk> how do we create an idea which is both tolerant to individuality <unk> and also to collectivity without polarizing the two into two different opposites of course the political agendas in the world has been very obsessed polarizing <unk> the two against each other into different very normative ideas <unk> between thinking and doing
