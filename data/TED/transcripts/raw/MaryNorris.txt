 <unk> i have spent the past thirty eight years trying to be invisible <unk>  i 'm a copy editor  i work at the new yorker and copyediting for the new yorker is like playing shortstop for a major league baseball team <unk> every little movement gets picked over by the critics god forbid you should commit an error  just to clarify copy editors don 't choose what goes into the magazine <unk>  we work at the level of the sentence maybe the paragraph the words the punctuation <unk>  our business is in the <unk> we impose house style <unk> every publication has a house style the new yorker 's is particularly distinctive <unk>  we sometimes get teased for our style imagine we still spell teen ager with a hyphen  as if that word had just been coined <unk>  <unk> and you know you 're reading the new yorker copyediting at the new yorker is a mechanical process <unk> there is a related role called query proofreading or whereas copyediting is mechanical  query proofreading is interpretive <unk> we make suggestions to the author through the editor to improve the emphasis of a sentence or <unk> point out unintentional repetitions and supply compelling alternatives  our purpose is to make the author look good  note that we give our proofs not directly to the author but to the editor this often creates a good cop bad cop dynamic in which the copy editor i 'll use that as an umbrella term is invariably the <unk> bad cop  if we do our job well we 're invisible <unk> but as soon as we make a mistake <unk> we copy editors become glaringly visible  here is the most recent mistake that was laid at my door [ last tuesday <unk> where were the new yorker 's fabled copy editors a reader wrote didn 't the writer mean <unk> ouch there 's no excuse for this mistake <unk> but i like it <unk> ruby was seventy six but she retained her authoritative bearing <unk> only her unsteady gait belied her age ] he added surely someone at the new yorker knows the meaning of ' belied ' and that it is the opposite of how it is used in this sentence come on get it together  belie  to give a false impression it should have been e b white once wrote of commas in the new yorker they fall with the precision of knives outlining a body  and it 's true we get a lot of complaints about commas are there really two commas in ' martin luther king jr boulevard '  there may not be on the sign but <unk> if we must have commas around at least <unk> we might change it up by using dashes around that phrase <unk> cords not chords ] the outraged reader added  i 'm sure i 'm not the first to write regarding this egregious proofreading error <unk> but i 'm equally sure i won 't be the last <unk> i used to like getting mail <unk> there is a pact between writers and editors the editor never sells out the writer never goes <unk> public about bad jokes that had to be cut or stories that went on too long a great editor saves a writer from her excesses copy editors too have a code <unk> we don 't advertise our oversights  i feel disloyal divulging them here <unk> so let 's have look at what we do right  somehow i 've gotten a reputation for sternness <unk> sternness <unk> but i work with writers who know how to have their way with me <unk>  i 've known ian frazier or sandy since the early 80s and he 's one of my favorites  even though he sometimes writes a sentence that gives a copy editor pause  here is one from a story about staten island after <unk> a dock that had been broken in the middle and lost its other half sloped down toward the water its support pipes and wires leaning forward like when you open a box of linguine and it slides out ]  this would never have got past the grammarian in the days of yore <unk> but what could i do technically the like  <unk> but it sounds ridiculous as if the author were about to embark on an extended homeric simile as when you open a box of linguine  i decided that the hurricane conferred poetic justice on sandy and let the sentence stand  generally if i think something is wrong i query it three times <unk> i told sandy that not long ago in a <unk> moment of indiscretion and he said only three so he has learned to hold out recently he wrote a story for talk of the town that 's the section at the front of the magazine with short pieces <unk> <unk> on subjects ranging from ricky jay 's exhibit at the metropolitan museum to the introduction of doggie bags in france  <unk> a grammar query the justice was wearing black and sandy wrote [ her face and hands stood out like in an old mostly dark painting ] now <unk> unlike with the hurricane with this like the author didn 't have the excuse of describing hurricane damage like in this sense is a preposition and a preposition takes an object which is a noun  this like had to be an <unk> quoting someone who was assisting the justice [ it will be just a minute we are getting the justice <unk> the music industry spells it mic because that 's how it 's spelled on the equipment i 'd never seen it used as a verb with this spelling and i was distraught to think that mic 'ed would get into the magazine on my watch  new yorker style for <unk> abbreviated form is mike  finally there was a sticky grammar and usage issue in which the pronoun has to have the same grammatical number as its antecedent [ everyone in the vicinity held their breath is here <unk> but people say things like everyone held their breath all the time  to give it legitimacy copy editors call it the singular ' their ' as if calling it singular makes it no longer plural it is my job when i see it in print to do my best to eliminate it  <unk> everyone held his or her breath whatever i suggested had to blend in  i asked through the editor if the author would consider changing it to all in the vicinity held their breath  because all is plural i tried again all those present held their breath i thought this sounded vaguely judicial <unk> but the <unk> everyone held their breath he stood his ground two out of three isn 't bad  in the same issue in that piece on doggie bags in france there was the gratuitous use of the f word by a frenchman <unk>  i wonder when the mail comes in which will have offended the readers more
