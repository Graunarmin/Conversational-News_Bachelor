 <unk> i 'm a veteran of the starship enterprise <unk> i soared through the galaxy driving a huge starship with a crew made up of people from all over this world many different races many different cultures <unk> many different heritages all working together <unk> and our mission was to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no one has gone before <unk> am the grandson of immigrants from japan who went to america <unk>  boldly going to a strange new world <unk> seeking new opportunities  my mother was born in sacramento california <unk> my father was a san franciscan <unk>  they met and married in los angeles <unk> and i was born there <unk> i was four years old when pearl harbor was bombed on december seven one thousand nine <unk> <unk> by japan <unk> and overnight <unk> the world was plunged into a world war  america suddenly was swept up by <unk> american citizens of japanese ancestry were looked on with suspicion and fear and with outright hatred simply because we happened to look like the people that bombed pearl harbor  and the hysteria grew and grew <unk> the president of the united states <unk> franklin delano roosevelt ordered all <unk> <unk> on the west coast of america to be summarily rounded up with no charges with no trial with no due process due process this is a core pillar of our justice <unk> that all disappeared <unk> we were to be rounded up and imprisoned in ten barbed wire prison camps in some of the most desolate places in america <unk> the blistering hot desert of arizona <unk>  the sultry swamps of arkansas <unk>  the wastelands of wyoming idaho <unk> utah <unk> colorado <unk> and two of the most desolate places in california <unk> april 20th i celebrated my fifth birthday <unk>  and just a few weeks after my birthday <unk>  my parents got my younger brother my baby sister and me up very early one morning <unk> and they dressed us hurriedly  my brother and i were in the living room looking out the front window <unk> and we saw two soldiers <unk> marching up our driveway <unk> they carried bayonets on their rifles <unk>  they stomped up the front porch and banged on the door <unk>  my father answered it <unk> and the soldiers ordered us out of our home  my father gave <unk> and we walked out and stood on the driveway waiting for our mother to come out and when my mother finally came out she had our baby sister in one arm a huge duffel bag in the other <unk>  and tears were streaming down both her cheeks <unk>  <unk> never be able to forget that scene it is burned into my memory we were taken from our home and loaded on to train cars with other japanese american families  there were guards stationed at both ends of each car  as if we were criminals <unk> we were taken two thirds of the way across the country <unk>  rocking on that train for four days <unk> days and three nights to the swamps of arkansas <unk>  i still remember the barbed wire fence that confined me <unk> i remember the tall sentry tower with the machine guns pointed at us <unk>  i remember the searchlight that followed me when i made the night runs from my barrack to the latrine <unk> but to five year old me i thought it was kind of nice that they 'd lit the way for me to pee <unk>  i was a child <unk> too young to understand the circumstances of my being there  children are amazingly adaptable what would be grotesquely abnormal became my normality in <unk> the prisoner of war camps  it became routine for me to line up three times a day to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall  it became normal for me to go with my father to bathe in a mass shower  being in a prison a <unk> my normality  when the war ended <unk> we were released <unk>  and given a one way ticket to anywhere in the united states <unk>  my parents decided to go back home to los angeles <unk>  but los angeles was not a welcoming place  we were penniless everything had been taken from us <unk> and the hostility was intense <unk> first home was on skid row in the lowest part of our city <unk> living with derelicts drunkards and crazy people  the stench of urine all over on the street  in the alley in the hallway <unk>  <unk> it was a horrible experience and for us kids it was terrorizing <unk> i remember once a drunkard came staggering down fell down right in front of us <unk> and threw up  my baby sister said mama <unk> let 's go back home  because behind barbed wires was for us <unk> my parents worked hard to get back on their feet <unk> we had lost everything they were at the middle of their lives and starting all over <unk> they worked their fingers to the bone <unk> and ultimately they were able to get the capital together to buy a three bedroom home in a nice neighborhood <unk> and i was <unk> and i became very curious about my childhood imprisonment <unk>  i had read civics books that told me about the ideals of american democracy <unk>  all men are created equal  we have an inalienable right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness <unk>  and i couldn 't quite make that fit with what i knew to be my childhood imprisonment <unk> history books <unk> and i couldn i couldn 't find anything about it and so i engaged my father after dinner in long sometimes heated conversations we had many many conversations like that  and what i got from them was my father 's wisdom  <unk> he was the one that suffered the most under those conditions of imprisonment <unk> and yet he understood american democracy  he told me that our democracy is a people 's democracy  and it can be as great as the people can be but it is also as fallible as people are he told me that american democracy democracy is vitally dependent on good people who cherish the ideals of our system and actively engage in the process of making our democracy work <unk> and he took me to a campaign headquarters the governor of illinois was running for the presidency and introduced me to american <unk> and he also told me about young <unk> during the second world war <unk> when pearl harbor was bombed young <unk> <unk> like all young americans rushed to their draft board to volunteer to fight for our country that act of patriotism was answered with a slap in the face we were denied service and categorized as enemy it was outrageous to be called an enemy when you 're volunteering to fight for your country <unk> but that was compounded with the word <unk> took the word citizen away from us and imprisoned them for a whole year and then the government realized that there 's a wartime manpower shortage <unk>  and as suddenly as they 'd rounded us up they opened up the military for <unk> it was totally irrational <unk> but the amazing thing <unk>  the astounding thing is that thousands of young japanese american men and women again went from behind those barbed wire fences <unk> put on the same uniform as that of our guards <unk> leaving their families in <unk> to fight for this country <unk> they said that they were going to fight not only to get their families out from behind those barbed wire fences <unk> but because they cherished the very ideal of what our government stands for should stand for  and that was being abrogated by what was being done  all men are created equal <unk> and they went to fight for <unk> this country <unk> they were put into a segregated all <unk> <unk> unit and sent to the battlefields of europe <unk> and they threw themselves into it  they fought with amazing incredible courage and valor <unk>  they were sent out on the most dangerous missions and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate of any <unk> proportionally  there is one battle that illustrates that  it was a battle for the gothic line <unk>  the germans were embedded in this mountain hillside <unk> rocky hillside in impregnable caves  and three allied battalions had been pounding away at it for six months <unk> and they <unk> were stalemated the 442nd was called in to add to the fight but the men of the 442nd came up with a unique but dangerous idea the backside of the mountain was a sheer rock cliff <unk>  the germans thought thought an attack from the backside would be impossible the men of the 442nd decided to do the impossible  on a dark <unk> moonless night they began scaling that rock wall a drop of more than one thousand feet in full combat gear <unk> all night long on that sheer cliff  in the darkness some lost their handhold or their footing and they fell to their deaths in the ravine below <unk> they all fell silently not a single one cried out so as not to give their position away  the men climbed for eight hours <unk> straight <unk> and those who made it to the top stayed there until the first break of light <unk> and as soon as light broke <unk>  they attacked <unk> the germans were surprised <unk> and they took the hill and broke the gothic line  <unk> it was an amazing act  and when the war ended the 442nd returned to the united states as the most decorated unit of the entire second world war <unk>  they were greeted back on the white house lawn by president truman who said to them <unk> only the enemy but prejudice <unk> and you won  they are my heroes they clung to their belief in the shining ideals of this country <unk> and they proved that being an american is not just for some people that race is not <unk> how we define being an american <unk> they expanded what it means to be an american <unk> including <unk> that were feared and suspected and hated <unk> they were change agents <unk> and they left for me a legacy <unk> they are my heroes and my father is my hero who understood democracy and and guided me through it  they gave me a legacy and with that legacy comes a responsibility <unk> and i am dedicated to making my country an even better america to making our government an even truer democracy and because of the heroes that i have and the struggles that we 've gone through i can stand before you as a gay but even more than that i am a proud american <unk> thank you very much
