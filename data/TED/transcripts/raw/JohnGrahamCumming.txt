 <unk> you about is what i call the greatest machine that never was it was a machine that was never built <unk> and yet <unk> it will be built it was a machine that was designed long before anyone thought about computers <unk> if you know anything about the <unk> simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today and you would be correct except for you 'd have the wrong century the first computer was really designed in the <unk> not the 1930s and 1940s it was designed and parts of it were prototyped and the bits of it that were built are here in south kensington  that machine was built by this guy charles babbage <unk> now i have a great affinity for charles babbage because his <unk> hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture  laughter he was a very wealthy man and a sort of part of the aristocracy of britain and on a saturday night in marylebone  were you part of the intelligentsia of that period you would have been invited round to his house for a soiree and and he invited everybody <unk> kings <unk> the duke of wellington many many famous people and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines miss that era you know where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you but babbage  babbage himself was born at the end of the <unk> 18th century and was a fairly famous mathematician he held the post that newton held at cambridge and that was recently held by stephen hawking he 's less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of <unk> the reason he never made any of them he 's a classic nerd <unk> every time he had a good idea he 'd think that 's brilliant i 'm going to start building that one i 'll spend a fortune on it i 've got a better idea i 'm going to work on this one and i 'm going to do this one  he did this until sir robert peel then prime minister basically kicked him out of number ten downing street and kicking him out in those days that <unk> the thing he designed was this monstrosity here the analytical engine <unk> now <unk> just to give you an idea of this this is a view from above <unk> every one of these circles is a cog  a stack of cogs <unk> and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive  so as i go through this talk i want you to imagine this gigantic machine we heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like and i 'm going to take you through the architecture <unk> and tell you about this this machine which is a computer <unk>  so let 's talk about the memory the memory is very like the memory of a computer today <unk> except it was all made out of metal <unk>  stacks and stacks of cogs <unk> thirty cogs high imagine a thing this high of cogs hundreds and hundreds of them  and they 've got numbers on them it 's a decimal machine everything 's done <unk> he thought about using binary the problem with using binary is that the machine would have been so tall <unk> it would have been ridiculous as it is it 's enormous <unk> so he 's got memory  the memory is this bit over here <unk> you see it all like this  this monstrosity over here is the cpu the chip if you like of course it 's this big  completely mechanical this whole machine is mechanical <unk> this is a picture of a prototype for part of the cpu which is in the science museum the cpu could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic so addition multiplication subtraction <unk> division which already is a bit of a feat in metal  but it could also do something that a computer does and a calculator doesn 't  this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision it could do the if then for basic programmers <unk> and that fundamentally made it into a computer <unk> it could compute it couldn 't just calculate it could do more now if we look at this <unk> and we stop for a minute <unk> and we think about chips today we can 't look inside a silicon chip it 's just so tiny <unk> <unk> yet if you did you would see something very very similar to this there 's this incredible complexity in the cpu  <unk> bit over here which is incredibly complicated <unk> all this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does but of course you need to program this thing and of course babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the ' 50s ' 60s and ' 70s which is punch cards <unk>  this thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here <unk> and this is a program in the science museum just not far from here created by charles babbage that is sitting there you can go see it waiting for the machine to be built <unk>  and there 's not just one of these there 's many of them he prepared programs anticipating this would happen now the reason they used punch cards was that jacquard in france had created the jacquard loom which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards <unk> so he was just repurposing the technology of the day and like everything else he did he 's using the technology of his cogs <unk> steam mechanical devices ironically born the same year as charles babbage was michael faraday <unk> who would completely revolutionize everything with the dynamo <unk> transformers all these sorts of things babbage of course wanted to use proven technology so steam and things <unk> you 've got a computer now you 've got punch cards a cpu and memory you need accessories you 're going to come with you 're not just going to have that so first of all you had sound <unk>  you had a bell <unk> so if anything went wrong or the machine needed the attendant to come to it there was a bell it could ring  and there 's actually an instruction on the punch card which says ring the bell <unk> and everyone needs a printer this is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his called the difference engine no two which he never built but which the science museum did build in the ' 80s and ' 90s  it 's completely mechanical again a printer it prints just numbers because he was obsessed with numbers <unk> but it does print onto paper and it even does word wrapping so <unk> to do anything with graphics so he said well i need a plotter i 've got a big piece of paper and an ink pen and i 'll make it plot so he designed a plotter as well and  you know at that point i think he got pretty much a pretty good machine <unk> along comes this woman ada lovelace now imagine these soirees all these great and good comes along this lady is the <unk> lord byron and her mother being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of lord byron 's madness and badness thought i know the solution mathematics is the solution we 'll teach her mathematics that 'll calm her down  because of course <unk>  there 's never been a mathematician mathematician that 's gone crazy so <unk> to one of these soirees with her mother <unk> and charles babbage you know gets out his machine the duke of wellington is there you know get out the machine obviously demonstrates it and she gets it  she 's the only person in his lifetime really who said i understand what this does and i understand the future of this machine  and we owe to her an enormous amount because we know a lot about the machine that babbage was intending to build because of her now <unk> some people call her the first programmer this is actually from one of the paper that she translated this is a program written in a particular style <unk> it 's not historically totally accurate that she 's the first programmer and actually she did something more amazing rather than just being a programmer <unk> she saw something that babbage didn 't  babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics <unk>  he was building a machine to do mathematics <unk>  and lovelace <unk> said you could do more than mathematics on this machine  and just as you do everyone in this room already 's got a computer on them right now because they 've got a phone <unk>  if you go into that phone every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics it 's all numbers at the bottom <unk>  whether it 's video or text or music or voice it 's all numbers it 's all  <unk> underlying it mathematical functions happening and lovelace said just because you 're doing mathematical functions and symbols doesn 't mean these things can 't represent other things in the real world such as music  this was a huge leap <unk> because babbage is there saying we could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graphs and lovelace is there and she says look this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically so this is what i call lovelace 's leap when you say she 's a programmer <unk>  she did do some but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be much much more than this  now a hundred years later this guy comes along alan turing and in <unk> <unk> and invents the computer all over again now of course babbage 's machine was entirely mechanical turing 's machine was entirely theoretical both of these guys were <unk> from a mathematical perspective but turing told us something very important he laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science and said it doesn 't matter how you make a computer it doesn 't matter if your computer 's mechanical  like babbage 's was or electronic like computers are today <unk> or perhaps in the future  <unk> mechanical again once we get into nanotechnology  we could go back to babbage 's machine and just make it tiny all those things are computers there is in a sense a computing essence this is called the <unk> churchturing thesis  and so suddenly you get this link where you say this thing babbage had built really was a computer in fact it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers <unk>  only really slowly  to give you an idea of how slowly it had about 1k of memory it used punch cards which were being fed in and it ran about ten thousand times slower the first <unk> zx81  it did have a ram pack you could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to  so where does that bring us today so there are plans over in swindon <unk> the science museum archives there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by charles babbage about this analytical engine  one of those is a set of plans that we call plan twenty eight  and that is also the name of a charity that i started with doron swade <unk> who was the curator of computing at the science museum <unk> and also the person who drove the project to build a difference engine <unk> and our plan is to build it  here in south kensington <unk> we will build the analytical <unk> the project has a number of parts to it one was the scanning of babbage 's archive that 's been done the second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build  the third part is a computer simulation of that machine  and the last part is to physically build it at the science museum <unk> when it 's built you 'll finally be able to understand how a computer works because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you you 've got to look at this humongous thing and say ah  i see the memory operating i see the cpu operating i hear it operating i probably smell it operating  laughter but in between that we 're going to do a simulation <unk> babbage himself wrote he said as soon as the analytical engine exists <unk> it will surely guide the future course of science of course he never built it because he was always fiddling with new plans  but when it did get built of course in the 1940s  everything changed <unk> now i 'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like in motion with a video which shows just one part of the <unk> cpu mechanism working so this is just three sets of cogs <unk>  and it 's going to add this is the adding mechanism in in action so you imagine this gigantic machine so give me five years before the
