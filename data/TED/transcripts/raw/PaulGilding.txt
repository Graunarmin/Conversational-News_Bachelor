 <unk> let me begin with four words that will provide the context for this week <unk> four words that will come to define this century  here they are the earth is <unk> 's full of us it 's full of our stuff full of our waste full of our demands <unk>  yes we are a brilliant and creative species but we 've created a little too much stuff so much that our economy is now bigger than its host our planet  this is not a philosophical statement this is just science <unk> analyses of this but they all draw the same conclusion that we 're living beyond our means  the eminent scientists of the global footprint network for example calculate that we need about one point five earths to sustain this economy  in other words  to keep operating at our current level we need fifty percent more earth than we 've got <unk> in financial terms this would be like always spending fifty percent more than you earn going further into debt every year <unk>  but of course you can 't borrow natural resources so we 're burning through our capital or stealing from the future  so when i say full i mean really full well past any margin for error well past any dispute about <unk> methodology  what this means is our economy is unsustainable i 'm not saying it 's not nice or pleasant or that it 's bad for polar bears or forests though it certainly is  what i 'm saying is our approach is simply unsustainable <unk> in other words <unk> thanks to those pesky laws <unk> but that 's not possible you might think we can 't stop economic growth because that 's what will stop economic growth <unk> it will stop because of the end of trade resources <unk> it will stop because of the growing demand of us on on all the resources all the capacity <unk> all the systems of the earth which is now having economic damage <unk> when we think about economic growth stopping we go that 's not possible because economic growth is so essential to our society that is is rarely questioned <unk>  although growth has certainly delivered many benefits <unk> it is an idea so essential that we tend not to understand the possibility of it not being around <unk> even though it has delivered many benefits <unk> it is based on a crazy idea the crazy idea being that we can <unk> have infinite growth on a finite planet <unk>  and i 'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes that the crazy idea is just that it is crazy <unk> and with the earth full <unk> it 's game over  come on you 're thinking that 's not possible <unk>  technology is amazing people are innovative there are so many ways we can improve the way we do things we can surely sort this out  <unk> true <unk> well it 's mostly true <unk> we are certainly amazing and we regularly solve complex problems with amazing creativity  so if our problem was to get the human economy down from one hundred and fifty percent to one hundred percent of the earth 's capacity we could do that the problem is we 're just warming up this growth engine <unk> we plan to take this <unk> make it twice as big and then make it four times as big not in some distant future <unk> but in less than forty years in the life time of most of you  china plans to be there in just twenty years <unk>  the only problem with this plan is that it 's not possible <unk>  in response some people <unk> argue but we need growth we need it to solve poverty we need it to develop technology we need it to keep social stability <unk> i find this argument fascinating as though <unk> we can kind of bend the rules of physics to suit our needs it 's like the earth doesn 't care what we need mother nature <unk> she just sets rules and describes consequences <unk>  and these are not esoteric limits this is about food and water <unk> soil and climate the basic practical and economic foundations of our lives <unk>  so the idea that we can smoothly transition to a <unk> economy transformed by science and technology so that nine billion people can live in two thousand and fifty a life of abundance and digital downloads is a delusion it 's not that it 's not possible to feed clothe and house us all and have us live live decent lives <unk>  it certainly is but the idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong <unk> and it 's dangerously wrong <unk> because it means we 're not getting ready for what 's really going to happen  <unk> happens when you operate a system past its limits and then keep on going at an is that the system stops working and breaks down <unk> and that 's what will happen to us  many of you will be thinking <unk> but surely we can still stop this if it 's that bad <unk> bad we 'll react let 's just think through that idea now we 've had fifty years of warnings we 've had science proving the urgency of change we 've had economic analysis pointing out that not only can we afford it it 's cheaper to act early <unk>  and yet the reality is we 've done pretty much nothing to change course we 're not even slowing down <unk> last year on climate for example <unk> we had the highest global emissions ever <unk>  the story on food on water on soil on climate is all much the same  i actually don 't say this in despair <unk> i 've done my grieving about the loss i accept where we are it is sad <unk> <unk> but it is also time that we ended our denial and recognized that we 're not acting we 're not close to acting and we 're not going to act until this crisis hits the economy  and that 's why the end of growth is the central issue and the event that we need to get ready for so when does this transition <unk> when does this breakdown begin <unk>  in my view <unk> it is well underway <unk> i know most people don 't see it that way we tend to look at the world not as the integrated system that it is  but as a series of individual issues <unk> we see the occupy protests we see spiraling debt crises we see growing inequality we see money 's influence on politics we see resource constraint food and oil <unk> but we see mistakenly each of these issues as individual problems to be solved <unk>  in fact <unk> it 's the system in the painful process of breaking down our system  of debt fueled economic growth  of ineffective democracy of overloading planet earth is eating itself alive <unk> i could give you countless studies and evidence to prove this but i won 't because if you want to see it that <unk> evidence is all around you <unk> i want to talk to you about fear <unk>  i want to do so because <unk> in my view <unk> the most important issue we face is how we respond to this question the crisis is now inevitable <unk> issue is how will we react  of course we can 't know what will happen the future is inherently uncertain but let 's just think through what the science is telling us is likely to happen <unk> imagine our economy when the carbon bubble bursts when the financial markets recognize that to have any hope of preventing the climate spiraling out of control <unk>  the oil and coal industries are finished imagine china india and pakistan going to war as climate impacts generate conflict over food and water <unk> imagine the middle east without oil income <unk> but with collapsing governments imagine thirty percent unemployment in america as the global economy is gripped by fear and uncertainty <unk>  now imagine what that means for you your family your friends your personal financial security <unk> imagine what it means for your personal security as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why <unk> this was allowed to happen <unk>  imagine what you 'll tell your children when they ask you so in two thousand and twelve <unk> mom and dad what was it like when you 'd had the hottest decade on record for the third decade in a row <unk>  when every scientific body in the world was saying you 've got a major problem <unk>  when the oceans were acidifying when oil and food prices were spiking they were rioting in the streets of london and occupying wall street <unk> when the system was so clearly breaking down mom and dad <unk>  what did you do what were you thinking  so how do you feel when the lights go out on the global economy in your <unk> when your assumptions about the future fade away and something very different emerges just take a moment and take a breath and think what do you feel at this point <unk> fear  of course we can 't know what 's going to happen and we have to live with uncertainty <unk> but when we think about the kind of possibilities i paint <unk>  we should feel a bit of fear <unk>  we are in danger <unk> all of us and we 've evolved to respond to danger with fear to motivate a powerful response  to help us bravely face a threat <unk>  but this time it 's not a tiger at the cave mouth  you can 't see the danger at your door <unk> but if you look you can see it at the door of your civilization <unk>  that 's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on because if we wait until the crisis takes hold we may <unk> panic and hide if we feel it now and think it through we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself <unk>  yes things will get ugly <unk>  and it will happen soon certainly in our lifetime but we are more than capable of getting through everything that 's coming <unk> you see those people that have faith that humans can solve any problem that technology is limitless that markets can be a force for good are in fact right <unk> the only thing they 're missing is that it takes a good crisis to get us going <unk>  when we feel fear and we fear loss we are capable of quite extraordinary things think about war after the bombing of pearl harbor it just took four days for the government to ban the production of <unk> civilian cars and to redirect the auto industry and from there to rationing of food and energy  think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done think about how an individual responds to a diagnosis of a life threatening illness and how lifestyle changes that previously were just too difficult suddenly become relatively easy we are smart <unk> in fact we really are quite amazing but we do love a good crisis and the good news this one 's a monster  sure <unk> if we get it wrong <unk> we could face the end of this civilization <unk>  but if we get it right <unk> it could be the beginning of civilization instead  and how cool would it be to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that 's certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way <unk>  scientists like james hansen tell us we may need to eliminate net co2 emissions from the economy in just a few decades <unk> i wanted to know what that would take so i worked with professor jorgen randers from norway to find the answer <unk> we developed a plan called the one degree war plan so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required  to my surprise <unk> eliminating net <unk> co2 emissions from the economy in just twenty years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap  not very cheap <unk> but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization <unk>  we didn 't calculate that precisely but we understand that 's very expensive <unk> you can read the details but in summary we can transform our economy <unk> we can do it with proven technology <unk> we can do it at an affordable cost we can do it with existing political structures the only thing we need to change is how we think and how we feel  and this is where you come in  when we think about the future i paint of course we should feel a bit of fear  but fear can be paralyzing or motivating <unk> we need to accept the fear and then we need to act <unk> we need to act like the future depends on it we need to act like we only have one planet <unk>  we can do this i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do  they 're wrong <unk>  we can be more we can be much more  we have achieved <unk> remarkable things since working out how to grow food some ten thousand years ago we 've built a powerful foundation of science knowledge and technology more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent <unk> meaningful and satisfying lives <unk> the earth can support that if we choose the right path <unk>  we can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society 's <unk> evolution like what do we want to be when we grow up <unk>  when we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality <unk>  well it 's time to grow up  to be wiser to be calmer to be more considered  like generations before us we 'll be growing up in war not a war between civilizations but a war for civilization for the extraordinary opportunity to build a society which is stronger and happier and plans on staying around into middle age <unk>  we can choose life over fear <unk> we can do what we need to do <unk> but it will take every entrepreneur <unk> <unk> every artist every scientist <unk> every communicator every mother every father every child <unk> every one of us  this could be our finest hour <unk> thank you
