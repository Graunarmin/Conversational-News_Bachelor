 <unk> and i don 't use botox as yet so i 'm clean but i do behave like you saw like i do that i sell dreams <unk> and i peddle love to millions of people back home in india who assume that i 'm the best lover in the world  if you don 't tell anyone i 'm going to tell you i 'm not but i never let that assumption go away  i 've also been made to understand there are lots of you here who haven 't seen my work <unk> and i feel really sad for you that doesn 't take away from the fact that i 'm completely <unk> self obsessed as a movie star should be  that 's when my my friends <unk> chris and juliet called me here to speak about the future you naturally it follows i 'm going to speak about the present me <unk> believe that humanity is a lot like me  it is it is it 's an aging movie star <unk> grappling with all the newness around itself <unk> wondering whether it got it right in the first place and still trying to find a way to keep on shining regardless <unk> i was born in a refugee colony in the capital city of <unk> my father was a freedom fighter my mother was well just a fighter like mothers are <unk> and much like the original homo sapiens we struggled to survive  when i was in my early 20s i lost both my parents  which i must admit seems a bit careless of me now but  <unk> i do remember the night my father died and i remember the the driver of a neighbor who was driving us to the hospital <unk> he mumbled something about dead people don 't tip so well and walked away into the dark <unk>  and i was only fourteen then and i put my father 's dead body in the back seat of the car <unk> and my mother besides me i started driving back from the hospital to the house <unk>  <unk> and in the middle of her quiet crying my mother looked at me and she said son when did you learn to drive  and i thought about it and realized <unk> and i said to my mom just now <unk> mom  so from that night onwards much akin to humanity in its adolescence  i learned the crude tools of survival  and the framework of life was very <unk> you just ate what you got and did whatever you were told to do i thought celiac was a vegetable <unk> and vegan of course was mr spock 's lost comrade in star trek you married the first girl that you dated and you were a techie if you could fix the carburetor in your car <unk> i really thought that gay was a sophisticated english word for happy <unk> and lesbian of course was the <unk> capital of portugal as you all know where was i  we relied on systems created through the toil and sacrifice of generations before to protect us <unk> and we felt that governments actually worked for our betterment science was simple and <unk> apple was still then just a fruit owned by eve first and then newton not by steve jobs until then <unk> <unk> what you screamed when you wanted to run naked on the streets you went wherever life took you for work <unk> and people were mostly welcoming of you <unk> migration was a term then still reserved for siberian cranes not human beings <unk> most importantly you were who you were and you said what you thought <unk> then in my late 20s i shifted to the sprawling metropolis of mumbai <unk>  and my framework like the newly industrialized aspirational humanity began to alter  in the urban rush for a new more embellished survival <unk> things started to look a little different i met people who had descended from all over the world <unk> became more and more fluid work began to define you at that time in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner and all the systems started to feel less reliable to me almost too thick to hold on to the diversity of mankind and the human need to progress and grow ideas were flowing with more freedom and speed <unk> and i experienced the miracle of human innovation and cooperation <unk> and my own creativity <unk> when supported by the resourcefulness of this collective endeavor <unk> catapulted me into superstardom <unk>  i started to feel that i had arrived <unk> and generally by the time i was forty i was really really flying <unk> i was all over the place you know i 'd done fifty films by then and two hundred songs and i 'd been knighted by the <unk> malaysians i had been given the highest civil honor by the french government <unk> the title of which for the life of me i can 't pronounce even until now laughter i 'm sorry france and thank you france for doing that but much bigger than that i got to meet angelina jolie  for two and a half seconds and i 'm sure she also remembers that encounter somewhere <unk> and i sat next to hannah montana on a round dinner table with her back towards me most of the time like i said i was flying from miley to jolie <unk> and humanity was soaring with me <unk> we were both pretty much flying off the handle actually and then you all know what happened <unk> the internet happened  i was in my late 40s and i started tweeting like a canary in a birdcage and assuming that you know people who peered into my world would admire it for the miracle i believed it to be <unk> but something else awaited me and humanity you know we had expected an expansion of ideas and dreams with the enhanced connectivity of the world <unk> we had not bargained for the <unk> thought of judgment of definition that flowed from the same place that freedom and revolution was taking place in everything i said took a new meaning everything i did good bad ugly was there for the world to comment upon and judge as a matter of fact everything i didn 't say or do also met with the same fate four years ago my lovely wife gauri and me decided to have a third child <unk> it was claimed on the net that he was the love child of our first child who was fifteen years old <unk> apparently he had sown his wild oats with a girl while driving her car in romania and yeah there was a fake video to go with it and we were so disturbed as a <unk> family my son who is nineteen now even now when you say hello to him he just turns around and says but bro i didn 't even have a european driving license  in this new world <unk> slowly reality became virtual and virtual became real <unk> and i started to feel that i could not be who i wanted to be or say what i actually thought <unk> and humanity at this time <unk> completely identified with me <unk> i think both of us were going through our midlife crisis <unk>  and humanity like me was becoming an overexposed prima donna <unk> i started to sell everything from hair oil to diesel generators humanity was buying everything from crude oil to nuclear reactors <unk> you know <unk> i even tried to get into a skintight superhero suit to reinvent myself <unk> i must admit i failed miserably <unk> and just an aside i want to say on behalf of all the <unk> and supermen of the world <unk> you have to commend commend them because it really hurts in the crotch that superhero suit  yeah i 'm being honest i need to tell you this here <unk> i happened to even invent a new dance form which i didn 't realize and it became a rage <unk> so if it 's all right <unk> and you 've seen a bit of me so i 'm quite shameless <unk> i 'll show you it was called the lungi dance <unk>  so if it 's all right i 'll just show you i 'm talented otherwise so it went something like this lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance  <unk> like you notice nobody could make any sense of what was happening except me <unk> and i didn 't give a damn really because the whole world <unk>  and whole humanity seemed as confused and lost as i was <unk> i didn 't give up then <unk> i even tried to reconstruct my identity on the social media like everyone <unk> i thought if i put on philosophical tweets out there people will think i 'm with it but some of the responses i got from those tweets were extremely confusing acronyms which i didn 't understand <unk> adidas somebody wrote back to one of my more <unk> thought provoking tweets and i was wondering why would you name a sneaker i mean why would you write back the name of a sneaker to me <unk> and i asked my 16 year old daughter and she enlightened me <unk> know if you know that so i wrote back wtf in bold to mr adidas <unk> thanking secretly that some acronyms and things won 't change at all wtf <unk>  but here we are i am fifty one years old like i told you <unk> want to tell you if there has been a momentous time for humanity to exist it is now <unk> because the present you is brave  the present you is hopeful <unk> the present you is innovative and resourceful and of course the present you is annoyingly indefinable <unk> and in this imperfect moment of existence <unk> feeling a little brave just before i came here i decided to take a good hard look at my face <unk> and i realized that i 'm beginning to look more and more like the wax statue of me at madame tussaud 's  yeah and in that moment of realization i asked the most central and pertinent question to humanity and me <unk> <unk> i 'm an actor like i told you a modern expression of human creativity <unk> the land i come from is the source of inexplicable but very simple spirituality in its immense generosity india decided somehow that i the muslim son of a broke freedom fighter who accidentally ventured into the business of selling dreams <unk> should become its king of romance  the badhshah of bollywood the greatest lover the country has ever seen  with this face yeah  laughter which has alternately been described as ugly <unk> the people of this ancient land embraced me in their limitless love and i 've learned from these people that neither power nor poverty can make your life more magical or less tortuous <unk> i 've learned from the people of my country that the dignity of a life a human being a culture a religion a country actually resides in its ability for grace and compassion i 've learned that whatever moves you <unk>  whatever urges you to create  to build whatever keeps you from failing whatever helps you survive is perhaps the oldest and the simplest emotion known <unk> and that is love a mystic poet from my land famously wrote <unk> actually saying that all the books of knowledge that you might read and then go ahead and impart your knowledge through innovation through creativity <unk> through technology <unk>  but mankind will never be the wiser about its future unless it is coupled with a sense of love and compassion for their fellow beings the two and a half alphabets which form the word <unk> able to understand that and practice it that itself is enough to enlighten mankind <unk> so i truly believe the future you  has to be a you that loves otherwise it will cease to flourish <unk> it will perish in its own self absorption  <unk> so you may use your power to build walls and keep people outside <unk> or you may use it to break barriers and welcome them in you may use your faith to make people afraid and terrify them into submission <unk> or you can use it to give courage to people so they rise to the greatest heights of enlightenment you can use your energy to build nuclear bombs and spread the darkness <unk> of destruction or you can use it to spread the joy of light to millions you may filthy up the oceans callously and cut down all the forests you can destroy the ecology or turn to them with love and regenerate life from the waters and trees you may land on mars and build armed <unk> or you may look for life forms and species to learn from and respect and you can use all the moneys we all have earned to wage futile wars and give guns in the hands of little children to kill each other with <unk> or you can use it to make more food to fill their stomachs <unk> my country has taught me the capacity for a human being to love is akin to godliness <unk> it shines forth in a world which civilization <unk> i think already has tampered too much with  in the last few days the talks here the wonderful people coming and showing their talent <unk>  talking about individual achievements the innovation the technology the sciences the knowledge we are gaining <unk> being here in the presence of ted talks and all of you are reasons enough for us to celebrate the future us but within that celebration the quest to cultivate our capacity for love and compassion has to assert itself has to assert itself just as equally <unk> so i believe the future you is an infinite you <unk> you it 's called a chakra in india like a circle <unk> it ends where it begins from to complete itself  a you that perceives time and space differently understands both your your unimaginable <unk> in the larger context of the universe a you that returns back to the original innocence of humanity which loves from the purity of heart which sees from the eyes of like an aging movie star who has been made to believe that there is a possibility of a world which is completely <unk> wholly in love with itself a world really <unk> it has to be a you to create a world which is its
