 <unk> today i 'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds <unk>  and the problem i 'm going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy which is how can we know whether other people have minds  that is maybe you have a mind <unk> and everyone else is just a really convincing robot  <unk> 's a problem in philosophy but for today 's purposes i 'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind <unk>  and that i don 't have to worry about this there is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us as parents and teachers and spouses and novelists  which is why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or believes or perhaps more relevantly why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes <unk> novelists put this best like philip roth who said  and yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people <unk>  so ill equipped are we all to envision one another 's interior workings and invisible aims  so as a teacher and as a spouse this is of course a problem i confront every day <unk> but as a scientist i 'm interested in a different problem of other minds <unk> and that is the one i 'm going to introduce to you today <unk> and that problem is how is it so easy to know other minds  so to start with an illustration  you need almost no information one snapshot of a stranger to guess what this woman is thinking or what this man is <unk> and put another way the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds our brain  is made up of pieces brain cells that we share with all other animals <unk> with monkeys and mice and even sea slugs <unk>  and yet you put them together in a particular network <unk> and what you get is the capacity to write romeo and juliet  or to say as alan greenspan did  i know you think you understand what you thought i said <unk> but i 'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what i meant  <unk> the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience is to stand with these ideas one in each hand <unk>  and to try to understand how you can put together simple units simple messages over space and time in a network <unk>  and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds <unk>  so i 'm going to tell you three things about this today obviously the whole project here is huge and i 'm going to tell you just our first few steps about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about <unk> other people 's thoughts some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job <unk>  and then finally to show that some of the differences between people in how we judge others can be explained by differences in this brain system <unk>  so first the first thing i want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain in your brains whose job it is to think about other people 's thoughts it 's called the right temporo parietal junction it 's above and behind your right ear <unk> and this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures i showed you or when you read romeo and juliet or when you tried to understand alan greenspan  and you don 't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems <unk>  so this brain region is called the right tpj and this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults they 're mit undergraduates laughter the second thing i want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other <unk> <unk> minds we weren 't always that way it takes children a long time to break into the system <unk> i 'm going to show you a little bit of that long extended process  <unk> have beliefs that are different from their own <unk> so i 'm going to show you a five year old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task rebecca saxe  this is the first pirate  his name is ivan and you know what pirates really like <unk> sandwiches  and ivan puts his sandwich over here  on top of the pirate chest <unk> and ivan says you know what i need a drink with my lunch and so ivan goes to get a drink  and while ivan is away the wind comes and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass <unk> and <unk> here comes the other pirate this pirate is called joshua <unk> and joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches so joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says yum yum yum yum yum <unk> i love cheese sandwiches  and he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest <unk> ivan comes back and he says i want my cheese sandwich so which one do you think ivan is going to take child i think he is going to take that one rs yeah you think he 's going to take that one all right let 's see oh yeah  you were right he took that one <unk>  so that 's a five year old who clearly understands that other people can have false beliefs and what the consequences are for their actions now i 'm going to show you a <unk> three year old who got the same puzzle <unk> ivan says i want my cheese sandwich which sandwich is he going to take do you think he 's going to take that one let 's see what happens <unk> let 's see what he does here comes ivan and he says i want my cheese sandwich and he takes this one he predicts ivan will take the sandwich that 's really his <unk>  and second when he sees ivan taking the sandwich where he left his <unk> where we would say he 's taking that one because he thinks it 's his  the three year old comes up with another explanation he 's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn 't want it because now it 's dirty on the ground <unk> so that 's why he 's taking the other sandwich <unk> now of course development doesn 't end at five <unk> and we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people 's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now not for an action prediction <unk> but for a moral judgment <unk>  so first i 'm going to show you the three year old again rs  so is ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua 's sandwich child yeah rs should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua 's sandwich child yeah  <unk> so it 's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of ivan to take joshua 's sandwich <unk> since he thinks ivan only took joshua 's sandwich to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich <unk>  but now i 'm going to show you the five year old remember the <unk> five year old completely understood why ivan took joshua 's sandwich rs was ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua 's sandwich child  um yeah <unk> and so it is not until age seven that we get what looks more like an adult response rs should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua 's sandwich <unk> because the wind should get in trouble he says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches  and now what we 've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what 's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about <unk> <unk> other people 's thoughts <unk> so the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region the right tpj being used while children are thinking about <unk> other people <unk> but it 's not quite like the adult brain  so whereas in the adults as i told you this brain region is almost completely specialized it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people 's thoughts in children it 's much less so when they are age five to eight <unk> the age range of the children i just showed you  and actually if we even look at eight to 11 year olds getting into early adolescence they still don 't have quite an and so what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence <unk> both the cognitive system <unk> our mind 's ability to think about other minds <unk> and the brain system that supports it are continuing slowly to develop <unk>  but of course as you 're probably aware even in adulthood <unk> people differ from one another in how good they <unk> are at thinking of other minds how often they do it and how accurately <unk>  and so what we wanted to know was could differences among adults in how they think about other people 's thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region <unk>  so the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids and i 'm going to give that to you now <unk>  so grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory and they take a break for coffee and grace 's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee  grace goes to make the coffee <unk> finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder which is sugar <unk>  but the powder is labeled deadly poison so grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison and she puts it in her friend 's coffee  and her friend drinks the coffee and is fine how many people think it was morally permissible for grace to put the powder in <unk> so we ask people how much should grace be blamed in this case which we call a failed attempt to harm <unk>  and we can compare that to another case where everything in the real world is the same the powder is still sugar <unk> but what 's different is what grace thinks now she thinks the powder is sugar  and perhaps unsurprisingly if grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friend 's coffee <unk> people say she deserves no blame at all  whereas if she thinks the powder was poison <unk> even though it 's really sugar now people say she deserves a lot of blame even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same  and in fact they say she deserves more blame in this case <unk> the failed attempt to harm <unk>  than in another case <unk>  which we call an accident where grace thought the powder was sugar because it was labeled sugar and by the coffee machine but actually the powder was poison <unk>  so even though when the powder was poison <unk> the friend drank the coffee and died <unk> people say grace deserves less blame in that case when she innocently thought it was sugar <unk> than in the other case where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred  people though disagree a little bit about exactly how much blame grace should get in the accident case some people think she should deserve more blame <unk> and other people less and what i 'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they 're making that judgment <unk>  so what i 'm showing you from left to right is how much activity there was in this brain region <unk> and from top to bottom how much blame people said that grace deserved <unk>  and what you can see is on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region <unk> people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident <unk>  whereas on the right <unk> where there was a lot of activity <unk> people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief <unk> belief and said she deserved a lot less blame for causing the accident <unk>  so that 's good but of course what we 'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region <unk> and see if we could change people 's moral judgment <unk>  and we do have such a tool it 's called trans cranial magnetic stimulation or tms this is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebody 's skull into a small region of their brain <unk> and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region <unk>  so i 'm going to show you a demo of this first i 'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse i 'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine when you hear clicks we 're turning the machine on  so now i 'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain to the part of my brain that controls my hand <unk> so there is no physical force just a magnetic pulse woman ready rebecca rs  okay so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain <unk> and we can use that same pulse  <unk> now applied to the rtpj to ask if we can change people 's moral judgments so these are the judgments i showed you before people 's normal moral judgments <unk>  and then we can apply tms to the rtpj and ask how people 's judgments change and the first thing is people can still do this task overall so their judgments of the case when everything was fine remain the same they say she deserves no blame  but in the case of a failed attempt to harm <unk> where grace thought that it was poison <unk> although it was really sugar <unk> people now say it was more okay <unk> she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee  and in the case of the accident where she thought that it was sugar <unk> but it was really poison and so she caused a death <unk>  people say that it was less okay she deserves more blame  so what i 've told you today is that people come actually especially well equipped to think about other people 's thoughts we have a special brain system that lets us think about what other people are thinking this system takes a long time to develop <unk> slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence <unk>  and even in adulthood differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people <unk>  but i want to give the last word back to the novelists and to philip <unk> who ended by saying  the fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway it 's getting them wrong that is living getting them wrong and wrong and wrong  and then on careful reconsideration getting them wrong again <unk> magnetic pulses to change people 's moral judgments that sounds alarming  please tell me that you 're not taking phone calls from the pentagon <unk> where this work leads i mean you 're clearly an incredible human being but someone could take this knowledge and in some future not torture chamber do acts that people here might be worried about rs  yeah <unk> we worry about this so there 's a couple of things to say about tms one is that you can 't be tmsed without knowing <unk> it 's not a surreptitious technology it 's quite hard actually to get those very small changes the changes i showed you are impressive to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain but they 're small on the scale of the moral judgments that we actually make  and what we changed was not people 's moral judgments when they 're deciding what to do when they 're making action choices we changed their ability to judge other people 's actions <unk> and so i think of what i 'm doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial but studying the jury ca  is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education to perhaps bring up a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments rs  that 's one of the idealistic hopes the whole research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new <unk> until recently what we knew about the brain were the things that any other animal 's brain could do too so we could study it in animal models we knew how brains see and how they control the body and how they hear and and sense <unk>  and the whole project of understanding how brains do the uniquely human things learn language and abstract concepts and thinking about other people 's thoughts that 's brand new and we don 't know yet what the implications will be of understanding it ca so i 've got one last question the hard problem of consciousness that puzzles a lot of people the notion that you can understand why a brain works perhaps but why does anyone have to feel anything why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate you 're a brilliant young neuroscientist i <unk> chances do you think there are that at some time in your career someone you or someone else is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem rs  i hope they do and i think they probably won 't ca why rs it 's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing
