 <unk> there were so many right whales in cape cod bay off the east coast of the u s  that apparently you could walk across their backs from one end of the bay to the other  today they number in the hundreds and they 're endangered  like them <unk> species of whales saw their numbers drastically reduced by two hundred years of whaling where they were hunted and killed for their whale meat <unk> oil and whale bone  we only have whales in our waters today because of the save the whales movement of the <unk> it was instrumental <unk> in stopping commercial whaling and was built on the idea that if we couldn 't save whales what could we save  it was ultimately a test of our political ability to halt environmental destruction <unk>  so in the early ' 80s there was a ban on commercial whaling that came into force as a result of this campaign  whales in our waters are still low in numbers however because they do face a range of other <unk> unfortunately <unk> many people still think that whale conservationists like myself do what we do only because these creatures are charismatic and beautiful  this is actually a disservice because whales are ecosystem engineers <unk> they help maintain the stability and health of the oceans and even provide services to human society <unk>  so let 's talk about why saving whales is critical to the resiliency of the oceans <unk>  it boils down to two main things <unk>  whale poop and rotting carcasses as whales dive to the depths to feed and come up to the surface to breathe <unk> actually release these enormous fecal plumes  this whale pump as it 's called actually brings essential limiting nutrients from the depths to the surface waters where they stimulate the growth of phytoplankton which forms the base of all marine food chains  so really having more whales in the oceans pooping is really beneficial to the entire ecosystem  whales are also known to <unk> to undertake some of the longest migrations of all mammals <unk> gray whales off america migrate sixteen thousand kilometers between productive feeding areas and less productive calving <unk> or birthing areas and back every year <unk> as they do so they transport fertilizer in the form of their feces from places that <unk> have it to places that need it  so clearly whales are really important in nutrient cycling <unk> both horizontally and vertically <unk> through the oceans <unk>  but what 's really cool is that they 're also really important after they 're dead <unk>  whale carcasses are some of the largest form of detritus to fall from the ocean 's surface and they 're called whale fall as these carcasses sink they provide a feast to some 400 odd species including the hagfish <unk>  so over the two hundred years of whaling <unk> when we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans <unk>  we likely altered the rate and geographic distribution of these whale falls that would descend into deep oceans and as <unk> result probably led to a number of extinctions of species that were most specialized and dependent on these carcasses for their survival <unk>  whale carcasses are also known to transport about one hundred and ninety thousand tons of carbon which is the equivalent of that produced by eighty thousand cars per year from the atmosphere to the deep <unk> oceans <unk>  and the deep oceans are what we call carbon sinks because they trap and hold excess carbon from the atmosphere and therefore help to delay global warming  sometimes these carcasses also wash up on beaches and provide a meal to a number of predatory species on <unk> the two hundred years of whaling was clearly detrimental and caused a reduction in the populations of whales between sixty to ninety percent  clearly the save the whales movement was instrumental in preventing commercial whaling from going on but we need to revise this  we need to address the more modern pressing problems that these whales face in our waters today <unk> amongst other things <unk> we need to stop them from getting <unk> plowed down by container ships when they 're in their feeding areas and stop them from getting entangled in fishing nets as they float around in the ocean  we also need to learn to contextualize our conservation messages so people really understand the true ecosystem value of these creatures  so let 's save the whales again <unk> but this time <unk> let 's not just do it for their sake let 's also do it for ours <unk> thank you
