 <unk> a question i 'm often asked is where did i get my passion for human rights <unk> i grew up in the west of ireland <unk> wedged between four brothers two older than me and two younger than me  so of course i had to be interested in human rights and equality and justice and using my elbows and those issues stayed with me and guided me and in particular when <unk> i dedicated my presidency to having a space for those who felt marginalized on the island of ireland and bringing together communities from northern ireland with those from the republic trying to build peace and i went as the first irish president to the united kingdom and met with queen elizabeth and also welcomed to my official residence which we call ras an uachtarin the house of the president members of the royal family including <unk> notably the prince of wales <unk> and i was aware that at the time of my presidency <unk> was a country beginning a rapid economic progress we were a country that was benefiting from the solidarity of the european union indeed when ireland first joined the european union <unk> <unk> were parts of the country that were considered developing including my own beloved native county county mayo <unk> trade delegations here to the united states <unk> to japan to india <unk> to encourage investment <unk> to help to create jobs to build up our economy to build up our health system our education our development <unk>  what i didn 't have to do as president was buy land on mainland europe <unk> so that irish citizens could go there because our island was going underwater  what i didn 't have to think about either as president or as a constitutional lawyer was the implications for the sovereignty of the territory because of the impact of climate change <unk>  but that is what president tong of the republic of kiribati <unk> has to wake up every morning thinking about  he has bought land in fiji <unk> as an insurance policy what he calls migration with dignity  because he knows that his people may have to leave their islands  as i listened to president tong describing the situation i really felt that this was a problem that no leader should have to face and as i heard him speak about the pain of his problems <unk> i thought about eleanor roosevelt <unk>  i thought about her and those who worked with her on the commission on human rights which she chaired in <unk> and drew up the universal declaration of human rights for them it would have been <unk> unimaginable that a whole country could go out of existence because of <unk> climate change <unk>  i came to climate change not as a scientist or an environmental lawyer <unk> and i wasn 't really impressed by the images of polar bears or melting glaciers <unk> it was because of the impact on people  and the impact on their rights their rights to food and safe water health <unk> education and shelter <unk> and i say this with humility <unk> because i came late to the issue of climate change <unk> when i served as un high commissioner for human rights from <unk> remember making a single speech on climate change <unk> i knew that there was another part of the united nations the un convention on climate change that was dealing with the issue of climate change <unk> it was later when i started to work in african countries on issues of development and human rights <unk> and i kept hearing this pervasive sentence <unk> much worse now things are so much worse and then i explored what was behind that it was about changes in the climate climate shocks changes in the weather <unk>  i met constance okollet who had formed a women 's group in eastern uganda <unk> and she told me that <unk> she was growing up she had a very normal life in her village and they didn 't go hungry they knew that the seasons would come as they were predicted to come they knew when to sow and they knew when to harvest and so they had enough food  but in recent years at the time of this conversation they had nothing but long periods of drought <unk> and then flash flooding <unk>  and then more drought <unk>  the school had been destroyed <unk> livelihoods had been destroyed <unk> their harvest had been destroyed <unk> she forms this women 's group to try to keep her community together <unk>  and this was a reality that really struck me <unk> because of course  constance okollet wasn 't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that were <unk> i was very struck about the situation in malawi in january of this year  there was an unprecedented flooding in the country <unk> it covered about a third of the country  over three hundred people were killed <unk> and hundreds of thousands lost their livelihoods <unk>  and the average person in malawi emits about eighty kg <unk> emits about seventeen point five metric tons <unk> so those who are suffering disproportionately don 't drive cars don 't have electricity don 't consume very significantly <unk> and yet they are feeling more and more the impacts of <unk> the changes that are preventing them from knowing how to grow food properly and knowing how to look after their future <unk>  i think it was really the importance of the injustice that really struck me very forcibly <unk>  and i know that we 're not able to address some of that injustice because we 're not on course for <unk> for a safe world governments around the world agreed at the conference in copenhagen and have repeated it at every conference on climate that we have to stay below two degrees celsius of warming <unk> <unk> above pre industrial standards <unk> but we 're on course for about four degrees <unk> so we face an existential threat to the <unk> future of our planet <unk> and that made me realize that climate change is the greatest threat to human rights in the 21st century <unk>  and that brought me then to climate justice  climate justice responds to the moral argument both sides of the moral argument to address <unk> climate change first of all to be on the side of those who are suffering most and are most effected <unk>  and secondly <unk> to make sure that they 're not left behind again when we start to move and start to address climate change with climate action as we are doing in our very unequal world today <unk> it 's very striking how many people are <unk> in our world of seven point two billion people about three billion are left behind one point three billion don 't have access to electricity <unk>  and they light their homes with kerosene and candles both of which are dangerous <unk> and in fact they spend a lot of their tiny income on that form of lighting two point six billion people cook on open fires on coal <unk> wood and animal dung <unk> and this causes about four million deaths a year from indoor smoke inhalation and of course most of those who die are women <unk>  so we have a very unequal world and we <unk> scale and the transformative nature of the change which will be needed because we have to go to zero carbon emissions by about two thousand and fifty <unk>  if we 're going to stay below two degrees celsius of warming <unk>  and that means we have <unk> of the known resources of fossil fuels in the ground <unk>  it 's a very big change <unk> and it means that obviously industrialized countries must cut their emissions must become much more energy efficient and must move as quickly as possible to renewable energy  for developing countries and emerging economies <unk>  the problem and the challenge is to grow without emissions because they must they have very poor populations so they must develop without emissions <unk> and that is a different kind of problem  indeed <unk> no country in the world has actually grown without emissions  all the countries have developed with fossil fuels and then may be moving to renewable energy <unk> so it is a <unk> a very big challenge and it requires the total support of the international community with the necessary finance and technology and systems and support  because no country can make itself safe from the dangers of climate change this is an issue that requires complete human solidarity  human solidarity if you like  <unk> we are all in this together <unk> and we have to work together to ensure that we reach zero carbon by two thousand and fifty <unk>  the good news is that change is happening <unk> and it 's happening very fast  here in california there 's a very ambitious emissions target to cut emissions <unk> in hawaii they 're passing <unk> are very ambitious around the world <unk> in costa rica they have committed to <unk> on at the moment to convert electricity from tidal and wave power <unk> in order that we can leave the coal in the ground <unk>  and that change is both welcome and is happening very rapidly <unk> but it 's still not enough and the political will is still not enough  let me come back to president <unk> to live on their island and have a solution but it would take a lot of political will president tong told me about his ambitious idea to either build up or even float the little islands where his people live  <unk> of course is beyond the resources of kiribati itself  it would require great solidarity and support from other countries and it would require the kind of imaginative idea that we bring together when we want to have a space station in the air <unk> but wouldn 't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder and to allow a people to remain in their sovereign <unk> be part of the community of nations that is the kind of idea that we should be thinking about <unk>  yes <unk> the challenges of the transformation we need are big <unk>  but they can be solved <unk> we are actually as a people very capable of coming together to solve problems <unk>  i was very conscious of this as i took <unk> was an extraordinary year <unk> it was a year when the world faced what must have seemed almost insoluble problems the devastation of the world wars particularly the second world war the fragile peace that had been brought about the need for a whole economic regeneration <unk> but the leaders of that time didn 't flinch from this they had the capacity they had a sense of being driven by never again must the world have this kind of problem and they had to build structures for peace and security <unk> and what did we get what <unk> the charter of the united nations  the bretton woods institutions as they 're called <unk> the world bank <unk> and the international monetary fund  a marshall plan for europe a devastated europe <unk> to reconstruct it and indeed a few years later the universal declaration of human rights two thousand and fifteen is a year that is similar in its importance to and similar potential  there will be two big summits this year  the first one <unk> in september in new york is the summit for the sustainable development goals <unk>  and then the summit in paris in december to give us a climate agreement  the sustainable development goals are intended to help countries to <unk> live sustainably <unk> in tune with mother earth not to take out of mother earth and destroy ecosystems <unk> but rather to live in harmony with mother earth <unk> by living under sustainable development and the sustainable development goals will come into operation for all countries on <unk> climate agreement a binding climate agreement is needed because of the scientific evidence that we 're on a trajectory for about a four degree world <unk> and we have to change course to stay below two degrees <unk>  so we need to take steps that will be monitored and reviewed <unk> so that we can keep increasing the ambition of how we cut emissions <unk> and how we move more rapidly to energy <unk> so that we have a safe world  the reality is that this issue is much too important to be <unk> <unk> left to politicians and to the united nations it 's an issue for all of us <unk>  <unk> indeed <unk> the face of the environmentalist has changed because of the justice dimension <unk>  it 's now an issue for faith based organizations <unk> under very good leadership from pope francis <unk> and indeed <unk> the church of england which is divesting from fossil fuels <unk>  it 's an issue for the for the business community <unk> and the good news is that the business community is changing very rapidly except for <unk> the fossil fuel industries  laughter even they are beginning to slightly change their language but only slightly but business is not only moving rapidly to the benefits of renewable <unk> <unk> energy <unk> but is urging politicians to give them more signals <unk> so that they can move even more rapidly  that one of the greensboro four who had taken part in the woolworth sit ins said quite recently that climate change is the lunch counter moment for young people so lunch counter moment for young people of <unk> sort of real human rights issue of the 21st century because he said it is the greatest challenge to humanity and justice in our world  i recall very much the climate march last september and that was a huge momentum not just in new york <unk> but all around the <unk> world and we have to build on that  i was marching with some of the elders family <unk> and i saw <unk> a placard a little bit away from me <unk> but we were wedged so closely together because after all there were four hundred thousand people out in the streets of new york so i couldn 't quite get to that placard i would have just liked to have been able to step behind it because it said <unk> to have five grandchildren <unk> and i think about their world and what it will be like when they will share that world with about nine billion other people in two thousand and fifty <unk>  we know that inevitably it will be a climate constrained world because of the emissions we 've already put up there but it could be a world that is much more <unk> equal and much fairer and much better for health <unk> and better for jobs and better for energy security <unk> than the world we have now <unk>  if we have switched sufficiently and early enough to renewable energy <unk> and no one is left behind <unk> no one is left behind <unk> looking back seventy years i would like to think that they will look back that world will look back <unk> the decisions that made a difference <unk> and that put the world on the right pathway <unk> and we benefit now from that pathway that they will feel that somehow we took our responsibilities <unk> we did what was done <unk> <unk> in similar terms <unk> we didn 't miss the opportunity <unk> we lived up to <unk> is about  and somehow for me <unk> it 's captured in words of somebody that i admired very much she was a mentor of mine she was a friend <unk> she died much too young  <unk> she was an extraordinary personality a great champion of the environment <unk> wangari maathai <unk>  <unk> there comes a time when humanity is called upon to shift to a new level of consciousness <unk> to reach a higher moral ground  and that 's what we have to do we have to reach a new level of consciousness a higher moral ground <unk>  and we have to do it this year in those two big <unk> and that won 't happen unless we have the momentum from people around the world who say we want action now <unk> we want to change course <unk> we want a safe world a safe world for future generations a safe world for our children and our grandchildren and we 're all in this together
