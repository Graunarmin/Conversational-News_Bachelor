 <unk> we should ask ourselves the question why does poverty exist <unk> i mean there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs we all live in the same planet but there 's still a great deal of poverty in the world <unk> and i think so i want to throw a perspective that i have so that we can assess this project or any other project for that matter to see <unk> see whether it 's contributing or contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it  rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last sixty years <unk> and by and large this has failed and you can see this book written by someone who worked in the world bank for twenty years <unk>  <unk> economic growth in this country to be elusive by and large it did not work so the question is why is that  in my mind <unk> there is something to learn from the history of europe <unk> i mean <unk>  even here <unk> yesterday i was walking across the street and they showed three bishops were executed five hundred years ago right across the street <unk> so my point is there 's a lot of struggle has gone in europe where citizens were empowered by technologies <unk>  and they demanded authorities from to come down from their high horses <unk>  and in the end there 's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens  and democracies capitalism everything else flourished <unk>  and so you can see the real process of and this is backed up by this <unk> came down and citizens got up <unk>  but if you look if you have that perspective then you can see what happened in the last sixty years aid actually did the opposite  it empowered authorities and as a result <unk> marginalized citizens the authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and make make more money for to run their business because they were getting it from abroad <unk>  and in fact if you see oil rich countries where citizens are not yet empowered the same thing goes nigeria saudi arabia all sorts of countries because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way it empowers authorities without activating the <unk> citizens their hands legs <unk> brains what have you and if you if you agree with that then i think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people by the people for the people  and that is the real network effect if citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive so that their voices are heard <unk> then things would improve and to contrast that you can see the most important institution in the world the world bank is an organization of the government by the government for the governments  <unk> just see the contrast and that is the perspective i have and <unk> and one is cell phones recently the economist recognized this but i stumbled stumbled upon the idea twelve years ago <unk> and that 's what i 've been working on <unk>  so twelve years ago i was trying to be an investment banker in new york we had <unk> our colleagues were connected by a computer network and we got more productive because we didn 't have to exchange floppy disks we could update each other more more often but one time it broke down and it reminded me of a day <unk> there was a war going on in my country <unk> and my family moved out of an urban place where we used to live to a remote rural <unk> area where it was safer <unk> and one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling <unk> and i walked ten miles or so all morning to get there to the medicine man <unk> and he wasn 't there so i walked all afternoon back  so i had another unproductive day <unk> so while i was sitting in a tall building in new york <unk> i put those two experiences together side by side <unk> and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity whether it 's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village <unk> so naturally <unk> i the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty <unk> and if that 's the case then the question is how many telephones did we have at that time <unk> and it turns out that there was one telephone in <unk> bangladesh for every five hundred people  and all those phones were in the few urban places <unk> the vast rural areas where one hundred million people lived there were no telephones <unk>  so just imagine how many <unk> are wasted just like i wasted a day <unk> if you just multiply by one hundred million <unk> 's say losing one day a month <unk> whatever <unk>  and you see a vast amount of resource wasted and after all poor countries like rich countries one thing we 've got equal is their days are the same length twenty four hours <unk> so if you lose that precious resource where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries that 's a huge waste <unk>  so i started looking for any evidence that does connectivity really increase productivity <unk> i couldn 't find much really but i found this graph produced by the itu which is the international telecommunication union <unk> based in geneva they show an interesting thing that you see the horizontal axis is where you place your country <unk> so the united states or the uk would be here <unk> outside <unk>  and so the impact of one new telephone which is on the <unk> on the vertical axis is very little very little <unk>  but if you come back to a poorer country <unk>  where the gnp per capita is let 's say five hundred dollars or three hundred dollars then the impact is huge six thousand dollars  or five thousand dollars the question was how much did it cost <unk> to install a new telephone in bangladesh <unk> it turns out two thousand dollars <unk> so if you spend two thousand dollars  and let 's say the telephone lasts ten years <unk> and if five thousand dollars every year so that 's fifty thousand dollars <unk> so obviously this was a gadget to have <unk>  and of course if the cost of installing a telephone is going down because there 's a digital revolution going on then it would be even <unk> and i knew a little economics by then it says adam smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity <unk> but how would you specialize <unk> let 's say i 'm a fisherman and a farmer <unk> and chris is a fisherman farmer both are generalists <unk> so the point is that we could only the only way we could <unk> if we can connect with each other <unk>  and if we are neighbors i could just walk over to his house <unk>  but then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area <unk>  but in order to expand that you need a river or you need a highway or you need telephone lines <unk> but in any event it 's connectivity that leads to dependability and that leads to specialization that leads to productivity <unk>  so the question was i started looking at this issue and going back and forth between bangladesh and new york there were a lot of reasons people told me why we don 't have enough telephones <unk>  and one of them is the lacking buying power poor people apparently don 't have the power to buy <unk>  but the point is if it 's a production tool <unk> why do we have to worry about that i mean in america people buy <unk> and they put very little money down they get a car <unk> and they go to work the work pays them a salary the salary allows them to pay for the car over time the car pays for itself <unk> so if the telephone is a production tool <unk>  then we don 't quite have to worry about the purchasing power <unk>  and of course even if that 's true <unk> then what about initial buying <unk> question is why can 't we have some kind of shared access in the united states we have everybody needs a banking service but very few of us are trying to buy a bank <unk>  so it 's a bank tends to serve a whole community <unk> so we could do that for telephones <unk> and also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet <unk> be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money <unk> but the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures  see you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing for instance the internet was booming in the u s  because there were there were people who had computers <unk> they had modems <unk> they had telephone lines <unk> so it 's very easy to bring in a new idea like the internet <unk>  but that 's what 's lacking in a poor country <unk> so for example we didn 't have ways to have credit checks  few banks to collect bills etc <unk> but that 's why i noticed grameen bank which is a bank for poor people and had one thousand  one hundred branches twelve thousand employees two point three million borrowers <unk> and they had these branches i thought i could <unk> put cell towers and create a network and anyway to cut the time short so i started i first went to them and said you know perhaps i could connect all your branches and make you more efficient but you know they have after all evolved in a country without telephones so they are decentralized i there might be other good reasons but this was one of the reasons they had to be  and so they were not that interested to connect all their branches and then to be and rock the boat <unk> so i started focusing what is it that they really do  so what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank she typically buys a cow the cow gives milk and she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan <unk> this is a business for her <unk> but it 's milk for everybody else and suddenly i realized that a cell phone could be a cow because some way she could borrow two hundred dollars from the bank  get a phone and have the phone for everybody and it 's a business for her <unk> so i wrote to the bank <unk> and they thought for a while and they said it 's a little crazy but logical if you think it can be done come and make it happen so i quit my job i went back to <unk> bangladesh <unk> i created a company in america called gonofone which in bengali means people 's phone  and angel investors in america put in money into that i flew around the world  after about a million i mean i got rejected from lots of places <unk> because i was not only trying to go to a poor country i was trying to go to the poor of the poor country <unk> after about a million miles  <unk> substantial loss of hair i eventually put together a consortium <unk> and which involved the norwegian telephone company <unk> which provided the know how and the grameen bank provided the infrastructure to to spread the service to make the story short here is the coverage of the country you can see it 's pretty much covered even in bangladesh there are some empty places <unk> but we are also investing around another three hundred million dollars this year to extend that coverage <unk> now about that cow model i talked about there are about one hundred and fifteen thousand people who are retailing telephone services in their neighborhoods <unk> and it 's serving <unk> thousand villages which represent about eighty million people and these these phones are generating about one hundred million dollars for the company <unk> and two dollars profit per per entrepreneur per day <unk> which is like seven hundred dollars per year <unk> and of course it 's very beneficial in a lot of ways it increases income improves welfare  <unk> result is right now this company is is the largest telephone company with three point five million subscribers one hundred and fifteen thousand of these phones i talked about that produces about a third of the traffic in the network  and two thousand and four the net profit after taxes very serious taxes was one hundred and twenty million dollars <unk> and the company contributed about one hundred and ninety million dollars to the government coffers <unk> and again <unk> here are some of the lessons the government needs to provide economically viable services actually this is an instance where private companies can provide that governments need to subsidize private companies this is what some people think and actually private companies help governments with taxes  poor people are recipients poor people are a resource  services cost too much for the poor their involvement reduces the cost the poor are uneducated and cannot do much <unk> they are very eager learners and very capable survivors i 've been very surprised most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day  poor countries need aid businesses this one company has raised the if the ideal figures are even five percent true this one company <unk> is raising the gnp of the country much more than the aid the country receives and as i was trying to show you as far as i 'm concerned aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens  and this is a new project i have with dean kamen the famous inventor in america he has produced some power generators <unk> which we are now doing an experiment in bangladesh in two villages where cow manure is <unk> producing biogas <unk> which is running these generators and each of these generators is selling electricity to twenty houses each it 's just an experiment we don 't know how far it will go
