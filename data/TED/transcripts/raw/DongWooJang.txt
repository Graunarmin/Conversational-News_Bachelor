 <unk> it is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence <unk> and i believe this is true <unk> especially when i hear president obama often talk about the korean education system as a benchmark of success well i can tell you that in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the korean school system  also known as pressure cooker not everyone can do well in that environment <unk> while many people responded in different ways about our education system my response high pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building <unk> why bows i 'm not quite sure <unk>  perhaps in the face of constant pressure  my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows <unk>  if you think about it <unk> bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times  the area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the joseon dynasty  where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves  in order to raise the historical awareness of this fact the government has planted mulberry trees the seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight olympics  the area near these walls <unk> which nobody bothers to pay attention to had been left free from major intervention  and this is where i first <unk> found my treasures  as i fell deeper into bow making <unk> i began to search far and beyond my neighborhood <unk>  when i went on school field trips <unk> family vacations or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes <unk>  i wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that i sneaked <unk> inside my school bag <unk> and they would be somethings like saws <unk> knives <unk> sickles and axes that i covered up with with a piece of towel <unk>  i would bring the branches home <unk> riding buses and subways <unk> barely holding them in my hands <unk> and i did not bring the tools here to long beach <unk> security  in the privacy of my room <unk> covered in sawdust <unk> i <unk> and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape <unk> one day <unk> i was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place <unk> the rooftop of my apartment building a place where ninety six families call home  a customer from a department store across from my building called nine hundred and eleven  and i ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned <unk>  i want to take this opportunity to tell my mom in the audience today mom <unk> i was really and i will be more careful with open fire from now on  my mother had to do a lot of explaining <unk> telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson <unk>  i also researched extensively on bows around the world in that <unk> i tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow <unk>  i also worked with many different types of wood such as maple <unk> yew and mulberry  and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that i mentioned before  the most effective bow for me would be like this  <unk> when you draw and shoot the arrow  two belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight which means more power  three <unk> sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage and four <unk> horn used to store energy in compression after fixing breaking redesigning <unk> mending bending and amending  my ideal bow began to take shape <unk> and when it was finally done  it looked like this <unk>  i was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own this is a picture of korean traditional bows taken from a museum <unk> and see how my bow resembles them  thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention <unk> of my heritage <unk> learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me  you see <unk> i searched far and wide <unk> but never bothered to look close and near  from this realization <unk> i began to take <unk> interest in korean history <unk> which had never inspired me before in the end the grass is often greener on my side of the fence <unk> although we don 't realize it <unk>  now <unk> i am going to show you how my bow works <unk> and <unk> a bow may function in a simple mechanism <unk> but in order to make a good bow a great amount of sensitivity is required you need to console and communicate with the wood material <unk> each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being <unk>  and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow <unk>  i may be an [ odd ] student with <unk> i hope i am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you  my ideal world is a place where no one is left behind where everyone is needed exactly where they are like the fibers and the tendons in a bow  a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is <unk> the bow resembles me <unk> and i resemble the bow now <unk> i am shooting a part of myself to you  no better yet a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind did it strike you <unk> thank you
