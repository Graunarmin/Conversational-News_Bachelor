 <unk> having spent eighteen years as a child of the state in children 's homes and foster care <unk> you could say that i 'm an expert on the subject <unk>  and in being an expert i want to let you know that being an expert does in no way make you right in light of the truth <unk>  if you 're in care <unk> legally the government is your parent loco parentis <unk>  margaret thatcher was my mother  laughter let 's not talk about breastfeeding  harry potter was a foster child <unk> expectations was adopted <unk> superman was a foster child <unk> cinderella was a foster child <unk> lisbeth salander the girl with the dragon tattoo was fostered and institutionalized batman was orphaned <unk> the boys in michael morpurgo 's friend <unk> alem in benjamin zephaniah 's refugee boy luke skywalker luke skywalker oliver twist <unk> cassia in the concubine of shanghai by hong ying celie in in alice walker 's the color purple all of these great fictional characters all of them who were hurt by their condition all of them who spawned thousands of other books and other films all of them were fostered <unk> adopted or orphaned it seems that writers know that the child outside of family reflects on what family truly is more than what it promotes itself <unk> to be  that is  they also use extraordinary skills to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis  how have we not made the connection <unk> and why have we not made the connection between between these incredible characters of popular culture and <unk> religions <unk> and the fostered adopted or orphaned child in our midst it 's not our pity that they need <unk>  it 's our respect <unk>  i know famous musicians i know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists and top lawyers and television executives and magazine editors and national <unk> journalists and dustbinmen and hairdressers all who were looked after children fostered <unk> adopted or orphaned and many of them grow into their adult lives in <unk> fear of speaking of their background as if it may somehow weaken their standing in the foreground as if it were somehow kryptonite <unk> as if it were a time bomb strapped on the inside children in care <unk> who 've had a life in care <unk> deserve the right to own and live the memory of their own childhood  it is that simple my own mother and i should say this here she same to this country in in the late ' <unk> they found themselves pregnant and she sort of she had no idea of the context in which she 'd landed  in the 1960s i should give you some context in the 1960s if you were pregnant and you were single you were seen as a <unk> you were separated from your family by the state you were separated from your family and placed into mother and baby homes you were appointed a social worker <unk>  the adoptive parents were lined up <unk> it was the primary purpose of the social worker <unk> the aim to get the woman at her most vulnerable time in her entire life to sign the adoption <unk> papers <unk> so the adoption papers were signed <unk> the mother and baby 's homes were often run by nuns the adoption papers were signed the child was given to the adoptive parents and the mother shipped back to her community to say that she 'd been on a little break <unk>  a little break of shame for a woman for being a woman a little break  the adoption process took like a matter of months <unk> so it was a closed shop <unk> it 's kind of easy to patronize the past to forego our responsibilities in the present what happened then is a direct reflection of what is happening now everybody believed <unk> themselves to be doing the right thing by god and by the state for the big society <unk> at the time under the emperor haile selassie <unk> and she lands months before the enoch powell speech the rivers of blood speech she lands months before the beatles release the white album  months before martin luther king was killed it was a summer of love if you were white if you were black it was a summer of hate <unk> from oxford  she 's sent to the north of england to a mother and baby home and appointed a social worker <unk> it 's her plan you know i have to say this in the houses it 's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time while she studies <unk> but the <unk> they took me <unk> i was a <unk> i was a sign from god they said <unk> i was norman mark greenwood  now for the next eleven years all i know is that this woman this birth woman should have her eyes scratched out for not signing the adoption papers she was an evil woman too selfish to sign so i spent those eleven years kneeling and praying <unk>  i tried praying i swear i tried <unk> and then i was supposed to determine whether that was the voice of god or it was the voice of the devil and it turns out i 've got the devil inside of me who <unk> so anyway two years sort of passed and they had a child of their own and then another two years passed and they had another child of their own and then another time passed and they had another child that they called an accident which i thought was an unusual name  and i was on the cusp of sort of adolescence <unk> so i was starting to take biscuits from the tin without without asking i was starting to stay out a little bit late etc <unk> religiosity in their naivete <unk> my mom and dad which i believed them to be forever as they said they were <unk> my mom and dad conceived that that i had the devil inside of me <unk>  and what i should say this here because this is how they engineered my leaving <unk> they sat me at a table <unk> my foster mom and she said to me you don 't love us do you at eleven years old <unk> they 've had three other children i 'm the fourth the third was an accident <unk> and i said yeah of course i do because you do  my foster mother asked me to go away to think about love and what it is and to read the scriptures and to come back tomorrow and give my most honest and truthful answer  so this was an opportunity <unk> if they were asking me whether i loved them or not then i mustn 't love them which led me to the miracle of thought that i thought they wanted me to get to i will ask god for forgiveness and <unk> his light will shine through me to them <unk> how fantastic this was an opportunity <unk> the theology was perfect <unk> the timing unquestionable <unk> and the answer as honest as a sinner could get i mustn 't love you i said to them  but i will ask god for forgiveness because you don 't love us norman <unk> clearly you 've chosen your path  <unk> my social worker this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months he 's waiting for me in the car as i say goodbye to my parents <unk> i didn 't say goodbye to anybody  not my mother my father my sisters my brothers my aunts my uncles my cousins my grandparents  nobody  on the way to the children 's home i started to ask myself what 's happened to me it 's not that i 'd had the rug pulled from beneath me as much as the entire floor had been taken away when i got to the for the next four five years i was held in four different children 's homes <unk> on the third children 's home at fifteen <unk> i started to rebel <unk> and what i did was i got three tins of paint airfix paint that you use for models <unk> and i was it was a big children 's home big victorian children 's home and i was in a little turret at the top of it and i poured them <unk> red yellow and green the colors of africa  down the tiles <unk>  you couldn 't see it from the street because the home was surrounded by beech trees for doing this i was incarcerated for a year in an assessment <unk> center which was actually a remand center <unk> it was a virtual prison for young people by the way years later my social worker said that i should never have been put in there i wasn 't charged for anything i hadn 't done anything wrong but because i had no family to inquire about me <unk>  they could do anything to me <unk> seventeen years old <unk> and they had a padded cell they would march me down corridors in <unk> last size order  they i was put in a dormitory with a confirmed nazi sympathizer <unk> man who ran it was an ex army officer  every time i had a visit by a person who i did not know who would feed me grapes <unk> once every three months <unk> i was <unk> that home was full of young boys who were on remand for things like murder <unk> and this was the preparation that i was being given after seventeen years as a child of the state <unk> i have to tell this story <unk> i have to tell it because there was no one to put two and two together  i slowly became aware that i knew nobody that knew me for longer than a year see that 's what family does <unk> it gives you reference points <unk>  i 'm not defining a good family from a bad family i 'm just saying that you know when your birthday is by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is a mother a father a sister a brother an aunt an uncle a cousin a grandparent it matters to someone and therefore it matters to you understand <unk> i was fourteen years old tucked away in myself <unk> into myself <unk> and i wasn <unk> i 'm reporting back i 'm reporting back simply to say that when i left the children 's home i had two things that i wanted to do one was to find my family and the other was to write poetry in creativity i saw light in the imagination i saw <unk> the place where anger was an expression in the search for love a place where dysfunction is a true reaction to untruth i 've just got to say it to you all i found all of my family in my adult life i spent all <unk> of my adult life finding them and i 've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else
