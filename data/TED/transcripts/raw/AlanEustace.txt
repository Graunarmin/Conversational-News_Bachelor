 <unk> i grew up in orlando florida <unk> i was the son of an aerospace engineer <unk>  i lived and breathed the apollo program <unk> we either saw the launches from our backyard or we saw it by driving in the hour over to the cape <unk> i was impressed by obviously space and everything about it but i was most impressed by the engineering that went into it <unk>  behind me you see an amazing view a picture that was taken from the international space station <unk> and it shows a portion of our planet that 's rarely seen and rarely studied and almost never explored  that place is called the stratosphere <unk> if you start on the planet and you go up and up and up <unk> it gets colder and colder and colder  until you reach the beginning of the stratosphere and then an amazing thing happens it gets colder at a much slower rate and then it starts warming up and then it gets warmer and warmer until the point where you can almost survive without any protection  about zero degrees <unk> and then you end up getting colder and colder and that 's the top of the stratosphere  <unk> one of the least accessible places on our planet most often when it 's visited it 's by astronauts who are blazing up at it at probably several times the speed of sound and they get a few seconds on the way up and then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back in  <unk> but the question i asked is is it possible to linger in the stratosphere <unk>  is it possible to experience the stratosphere is it possible to explore the stratosphere i studied this using my favorite search engine for quite a while about a year <unk> and then i made a scary phone call it was a reference from a friend of mine to call taber maccallum from paragon space development corporation <unk> and i asked him the question is it possible to build a system to go into the stratosphere <unk> and he said it was  and after a period of about three years we proceeded to do just that  and on october twenty four of last year  <unk> i went up in a balloon to one hundred and <unk> eight hundred and ninety feet but who 's counting  came back to earth at speeds of up to eight hundred and twenty two miles an hour it was a four minute and <unk> descent <unk> and when i got to ten thousand feet i opened a parachute and i landed but this is really a science talk and it 's really an engineering talk <unk>  and what was amazing to me about that experience is that taber said yes <unk> i think we can build a stratospheric suit <unk>  and more than that come down tomorrow and let 's talk to the team that formed the core of the group that actually built it  they did something which i think is important <unk> which is they took the analogy of scuba diving <unk> so in scuba diving <unk> you have a self contained system you have everything that you could ever need <unk> you have a scuba tank <unk>  <unk> three years later this is what we have we 've got an amazing suit that was made by ilc dover ilc dover was the company that made all of the apollo suits and all of the extravehicular activity suits they had never sold a suit commercially  only to the government <unk> but they sold one to me which i am very grateful for  up here we have a parachute this <unk> all about safety <unk> everyone on the team knew that i have a wife and two small children ten and fifteen and i wanted to come back safely <unk> so there 's a main parachute and a reserve parachute and if i do nothing  the reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device the suit itself can protect me from the <unk> cold this area in the front here has thermal protection it will actually heat water that will wrap around my body <unk> it has two redundant oxygen tanks even if i was to get a quarter inch hole in this suit which is extremely unlikely  this system would still protect me from the from the low pressure of space the main advantage of this system is weight and complexity <unk> so the system weighs about <unk> five hundred pounds and if you compare it to the other attempt recently to go up in the stratosphere <unk> they used a capsule <unk>  and to do a capsule there 's an amazing amount of complexity that goes into it <unk> and it weighed about three thousand pounds and to raise three thousand pounds to an altitude of one hundred and thirty five thousand feet which was my target altitude it would have taken a <unk> to fifty million cubic feet  because i only weighed five hundred pounds in this system  we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler than what needs to be done for a much larger balloon <unk>  so with that i want to take you to roswell new mexico on october twenty four we had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night and <unk> here 's the suit <unk> again <unk> this is using the front loader that you 'll see in a second and i want to play you a video of the actual launch roswell 's a great place to launch balloons but it 's a fantastic place to land under a parachute <unk> especially when you 're going to land seventy miles away from the place you started that 's a helium truck in the background <unk> it 's darkness <unk> i 've already spent about an hour and a half a half pre breathing and then here you see the suit going on it takes about an hour to get the suit on <unk> astronauts get this really nice <unk> van to go to the launch pad but i got a front loader  you can see the top you can see the balloon <unk> that 's where the helium is  this is dave clearing the airspace with the faa for fifteen miles  and there we go that 's me waving with my left hand the reason i 'm waving with my left hand is because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway  my team forbade me from using my right hand so the trip up is beautiful it 's kind of like google earth in reverse  it took two hours and seven minutes to go up and it was the most peaceful two hours and seven minutes i was mostly trying to relax  my heart rate was very low and i was trying not to use very much oxygen <unk> you can see how the the fields in the background are relatively big at this point and you can see me going up and up <unk> it 's interesting here because if you look i 'm right over the airport and i 'm probably at fifty thousand feet  but immediately i 'm about to go into a stratospheric wind of over one hundred and twenty miles an hour <unk> this is my flight director telling me that i had just gone higher than anybody else had ever gone in a balloon <unk> and i was about four thousand feet from release this is what it looks like  you can see the darkness of space the curvature of the earth the fragile planet below <unk>  i 'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now <unk> goes wrong i want to be ready and the main thing that i want to do here is to have a release and fall and stay completely stable <unk> there 's the balloon going by <unk> fully inflated at this point <unk>  and there you can see a drogue parachute which i 'll demonstrate in just a second because that 's really important there 's the balloon going by a second time right now i 'm about at the speed of sound <unk>  there 's nothing for me to tell it 's the speed of sound <unk> and very soon i will actually be as fast as i ever get eight hundred and twenty two miles an hour <unk> down low right now and you can basically see the parachute come out right there at this point i 'm very happy that there 's a parachute out i thought i was the only one happy but it turns out mission control was really happy as well  the really nice thing about this is the moment i opened i had a close of friend of mine blikkies my parachute guy he flew in another airplane <unk> and he actually jumped out and landed right next to me  he was my wingman on the descent <unk> this is my landing but it 's probably more properly called a crash  i hate to admit it but this wasn 't even close to my worst landing <unk> you one thing that you might not have seen in that video <unk> but one <unk> the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release and what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute and a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me  and i 'll show you one of those right now <unk> if any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving <unk>  you probably used one of these <unk>  but the problem with one of these things <unk> right when you release you 're in zero gravity <unk>  so it 's very easy for this to just turn right around you and before you know it you can be tangled up or spinning <unk>  or you can release this drogue late  in which case what happens is you 're going down at eight hundred miles an hour and this thing is going to destroy itself and not be very useful <unk>  but the guys at united parachute <unk> came up with this idea and it was a roll that looks like that but watch what happens when i pull it out <unk>  it 's forming a pipe <unk>  this pipe is so solid that you can take this drogue parachute and wrap it around and there 's no way it will ever tangle with you <unk>  and that prevented a very serious <unk> so nothing is possible without an amazing team of people the core of this was about twenty people that worked on this for the three years <unk> and they were incredible people asked me what the best part of this whole thing was <unk> and it was a chance to work with the best experts in meteorology and ballooning and parachute technology and environmental systems and high altitude medicine <unk> it was fantastic it 's an engineer 's dream to work with that group of people and i also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at google both for supporting me during this effort and also covering for me in the times that i was away but there 's one other group i wanted to thank and that 's my family yay  i would constantly give them speeches about the safety of technology and they weren 't hearing any <unk> of it it was super hard on them and the only reason that my wife put up with it was because i came back incredibly happy after each of the two hundred and fifty tests and she didn 't want to take that away from me <unk> so i want to close with a story my daughter katelyn <unk> my 15 year old she and i were in the car <unk> and we were driving down the road and she was sitting there <unk> and she had this idea and she goes dad i 've got this idea  and so i listened to her idea and i said katelyn that 's impossible  and she looks at me and she goes dad after what you just did how can you call anything impossible  and i laughed <unk> and i said ok it 's not impossible it 's just very very hard and then i paused for a second and i said <unk> katelyn <unk> it may not be impossible it may not even be very very hard <unk> it 's just that i don 't know how to do it
