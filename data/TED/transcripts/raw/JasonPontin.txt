 <unk> buzz aldrin climbed out of apollo eleven 's lunar module and descended onto the sea of tranquility <unk> armstrong and aldrin were <unk> alone <unk> but their presence on the moon 's gray surface was the culmination of a convulsive <unk> collective effort  the apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the united states to get to the moon nasa spent around one hundred and eighty billion dollars in today 's money or four percent of the federal budget  apollo employed around four hundred thousand people <unk> and demanded the collaboration of twenty thousand companies universities and government agencies <unk>  people died including the crew of apollo one <unk>  but before the apollo program ended twenty four men flew to the moon <unk> twelve walked on its surface of whom aldrin <unk> following the death of armstrong last year is now the most senior  so <unk> they go they didn 't bring much back <unk> eight hundred and forty one pounds of old rocks and something all <unk> later emphasized a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home why did they go the cynical answer is they went because president <unk> <unk> kennedy wanted to show the soviets that his nation had the better rockets  kennedy 's own words at rice university <unk> provide a better clue <unk> why some say <unk> why choose this as our goal and they may well ask <unk> why climb the highest mountain <unk>  why thirty five years ago <unk> fly the atlantic <unk> why does rice play texas <unk> we choose to go to the moon <unk> we choose to go to the moon  we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things  not because they are easy <unk> but because they are hard jason pontin  to contemporaries apollo wasn 't only a victory of west over east in the cold war at the time the strongest <unk> emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology  they went because it was a big thing to do  landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs the first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis in the <unk> years of the century polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated  technology itself seemed to possess what alvin toffler in one thousand nine hundred and seventy called accelerative thrust  for most of human history we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail <unk> nine hundred and seventy no human beings have been back to the moon <unk> no one has traveled faster than the crew of apollo ten  and blithe optimism about technology 's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve such <unk> <unk> as going to mars <unk> creating clean energy curing cancer or feeding the world have come to <unk> seem intractably hard <unk>  i remember watching the liftoff of apollo seventeen i was five years old and my mother told me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of a saturn v rocket  i vaguely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions <unk> but i was absolutely certain there would be mars colonies in my lifetime so something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology has become a commonplace you hear it all the time <unk> we 've heard it over the last two days here at ted  it feels as if technologists have diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys with things like iphones and apps and social media <unk> or algorithms that speed automated trading  there 's nothing wrong with most of these things they 've expanded and enriched our lives <unk> but they they don 't solve humanity 's big problems  what happened so there is a parochial explanation in silicon valley <unk> which <unk> admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed intel microsoft apple and genentech <unk>  silicon valley says the markets are to blame in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs silicon valley says that venture investing shifted <unk> <unk> away from funding transformational ideas and towards funding incremental problems or even fake problems <unk>  <unk> mostly explains what 's wrong with silicon valley  even when venture capitalists were at their most risk happy they preferred small investments tiny investments that offered an exit within ten years v c s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and lengthy and <unk> funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial value  no the reasons we can 't solve big problems are more complicated and more profound  sometimes we choose not to solve big problems we could go to mars if we want <unk> nasa even has the <unk> outline of a plan <unk>  but going to mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal and that will never happen  we won 't go to mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on earth <unk>  sometimes we can 't solve big problems because our political systems fail  today less than two percent of the world 's energy consumption derives from advanced renewable sources such as solar wind and biofuels <unk> than two percent and the reason is purely economic <unk> coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels  we want alternative energy sources that can compete on price <unk> none exist now technologists <unk> business leaders and economists all basically <unk> <unk> agree on what national policies and international treaties would spur <unk> the development of alternative energy mostly a significant increase in energy research and development and some kind of price on carbon <unk>  but there 's no hope in the present political climate that we will see u s energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus <unk>  <unk> problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so  famines were long understood to be caused by failures in food supply <unk>  but thirty years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution  technology can improve things like crop yields or systems for storing and transporting food  but there will be famines so long <unk> as there are bad governments <unk>  finally big problems sometimes elude solution because we don 't really understand the problem <unk>  president nixon declared war on cancer in one thousand nine hundred and seventy one  but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy <unk> and it is only in the last ten years that <unk> effective viable therapies have come to seem real hard problems are hard  it 's not true that we can 't solve big problems through technology <unk> we can  we must but these four elements must all be present  political leaders and the public must care to solve a <unk> must support its solution it must really be a technological problem <unk> and we must understand it  the apollo mission which has become a kind of metaphor for technology 's capacity to solve big problems <unk> met these criteria <unk>  but it is an irreproducible model for the future it is not one thousand nine hundred and <unk> there is no galvanizing contest like the cold war no politician like john kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous and <unk> <unk> no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system  alone with our day and the solutions of the future will be harder won <unk>  god knows we don 't lack for the challenges <unk> thank you very much
