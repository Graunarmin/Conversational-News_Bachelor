 <unk> today i 'm going to share my personal journey with female genital mutilation feel free to cry <unk> laugh <unk> cross your <unk> or do anything your body feels like doing i 'm not going to name the things your body does <unk>  i was born in sierra leone did anybody watch blood diamond  if you have any thoughts i don 't have any diamonds on me <unk> by the way <unk> if you have heard of ebola well that 's in sierra leone as well <unk> i don 't have ebola you 're all safe don 't rush to the door <unk> be seated you 're fine i <unk> me why a man needs more than one wife men do you need more than one wife <unk> i don 't think so <unk> there you go he was looking for a heart attack <unk> that 's what i say oh yeah he was when i was three war broke out in sierra leone in <unk> i remember literally going to bed one night <unk> everything was good the next day i woke up bombs were dropping everywhere <unk> and people were trying to kill me and my family <unk>  we escaped the war and ended up in gambia in west africa <unk> ebola is there as well <unk> stay away from it  while we were there as refugees <unk> what was going to become of us  my mom applied for refugee status <unk> she 's a wonderful smart woman that one and we were lucky australia said we will take you in good job aussies before we were meant to travel my mom came home one day and said we 're going on a little holiday a little trip  she put us in a car and we drove for hours and ended up in a bush in a remote area in gambia  in this bush we found two huts an old lady came towards us she was <unk> <unk> very old she had a chat with my mom <unk> and went back then she came back and walked away from us into a second hut <unk>  i 'm standing there thinking this is very confusing i don 't know what 's going on the next thing i knew my mom took me into this hut <unk>  she took my clothes off <unk> and then she pinned me down on <unk> the floor  i struggled and tried to get her off me but i couldn 't  then the old lady came towards me with a rusty looking knife one of the sharp knives orange looking has never seen water or sunlight before  i thought she was going to slaughter me <unk> but she didn 't  she slowly slid down my body and ended up where my vagina is <unk> she took hold of what i now know to be my clitoris  she took that rusty knife <unk> and started cutting away inch by inch i screamed <unk> i cried <unk> and asked my mom to get off me so this pain will stop but all she did was say <unk> quiet this old lady sawed away at my flesh for what felt like forever and then when she was done she threw that piece of flesh across the floor as if it was the most disgusting thing she 's ever touched  they both got off me and left me there bleeding crying and confused as to <unk> what just happened <unk>  we never talked about this again very soon we found that we were coming to australia  and this is when you had the sydney olympics at the time <unk> and people said we were going to the end of the world there was nowhere else to go after australia  yeah that comforted us a bit it took us three days to get here <unk> we went to senegal <unk> then france and <unk> singapore <unk> we went to the bathroom to wash our hands <unk> we spent fifteen minutes opening the tap like this  then somebody came in slid their hand under and water came out and we thought is this what we 're in for like seriously <unk> we got to adelaide  <unk> small place where literally they dumped us in adelaide that 's what i would say they dumped us there we were very grateful  we settled and we liked it we were like we 're home we 're here  then somebody took us to rundle mall adelaide has only one mall it 's this small place <unk>  and we saw a lot of asian people my mom said all of a sudden panicking you brought us to the wrong place <unk> you must take us back to australia <unk> had to be explained to her that there were a lot of asians in australia and we were in the right place <unk> so fine it 's all good  my mom then had this brilliant idea that i should go to a girls school because they were less racist i don 't know where she read that publication  never found evidence of it to this day <unk>  six hundred white kids <unk> and i was the only black child <unk> person with a bit of a color on me <unk> let me say that chocolate color <unk>  there were no asians no indigenous  all we had was some tan girls girls who felt the need to be under the sun it wasn 't the same as my chocolate though not the same  settling in australia was quite hard but it became harder when i started volunteering for an organization called women 's health statewide and i joined their female genital mutilation program without any awareness of what this program was actually about <unk>  or that it related to me in any way <unk>  i spent months educating nurses and doctors about what female genital mutilation was and where it was practiced <unk> africa the middle east asia and now australia and london and america because  as we all know we live in a multicultural society and people who come from those backgrounds come with their culture <unk>  and sometimes sometimes <unk> they have cultural practices that we may not agree with but they continue to practice them <unk>  one day <unk> i was looking at the chart of the different types of female genital mutilation fgm i will just say fgm for short  type i is when they cut off the hood ii is when they cut off the whole clitoris and some of your labia majora <unk> or your outer lips <unk>  and type iii is when they cut off the whole clitoris and then they sew you up so you only have a little hole to pee and have your period  my eyes went onto type ii  before all of this i pretty much had amnesia <unk> i was in so much shock and traumatized by what had happened i didn 't remember any of it yes i was aware something bad happened to me <unk> but i had no recollection of what had happened  i knew i had a scar down there <unk> but i thought everybody had a scar down there this had happened to everybody else but when i looked at type ii  it all came back to me <unk> i remembered what was done to me <unk> i remembered being in that hut with that old lady and my mom holding me down <unk> words cannot express the pain i felt the confusion that i felt because now i realized that what was done to me was a terrible thing that in this society was called barbaric it was called mutilation <unk> my mother had said it was called circumcision but here it was <unk> i went home and said to my mom you did something this is not the african thing to do pointing at your mother <unk> but <unk> she 's used to me mouthing off <unk>  i 'm like those years ago <unk> you circumcised me <unk> you cut away something that belonged to me  she said yes i did  i did it for your own good <unk>  it was in your best interest <unk> if you were not circumcised you would get itchy down there women who are not circumcised get itchy all the time <unk> then they sleep around with everybody  you are not going to sleep around with anybody <unk> empowerment was very strange  that was the end of our first conversation <unk> i went back to school  these were the days when we had dolly and girlfriend magazines there was always the sealed section anybody remember those sealed sections <unk> the naughty bits <unk> pleasure and relationships and of course sex but it always assumed that you had a clitoris <unk> though and i thought  this doesn 't fit me this doesn 't talk about people like me i don 't have a clitoris <unk>  i watched tv and those women would moan like oh oh i was like these people and their damned clitoris <unk> what is a woman without a clitoris supposed to do with her life <unk> that 's what i want to know i want to do that too oh oh and all of that  didn 't happen so i came home once again and said to my mom dolly and girlfriend said i deserve pleasure <unk> that i should be having <unk> was dolly that said that and i thought to myself i had an inner joke in my head that said  i will marry a white man he won 't have that problem with me  so i said to my mom dolly and girlfriend said <unk> i deserve pleasure and do you know what you have taken away from me what you have denied me  you have invaded me in the most sacred way <unk> i want pleasure <unk> i want to get horny dammit <unk> she didn 't get it we came from two different worlds when she was growing up not having a clitoris was the norm <unk> it was celebrated  i was an african australian <unk> so once i went through this strange phase of anger and pain and confusion  i remember booking an appointment with my therapist yes i 'm an african who has a therapist there you go <unk>  and i said to her  i was thirteen i was a child i was settling in a new country i was dealing with racism and discrimination <unk>  english is my third language <unk> and then <unk> to her i feel like i 'm not a woman because of what was done to me <unk> i feel incomplete <unk>  am i going to be asexual  because from what i knew about fgm the whole aim of it was to control the sexuality of women <unk> it 's so that we don 't have any sexual desire <unk> asexual now will i just live the rest of my life not feeling like having sex not enjoying sex  she couldn 't answer my questions so they went unanswered  when i started having my period around the age of fourteen i realized i didn 't have normal periods because of fgm  my periods were heavy they were long and they were very painful <unk> then they told me i had fibroids they 're like these little balls sitting there one was covering one of my ovaries and there came then the big news  we don 't think you can have children khadija and once again <unk> i was an angry black woman <unk> i went home and i said to my mom  your act <unk> your action no matter what your may defense may be because she thought she did it out love <unk> did out of love is harming me and it 's hurting me <unk> what do you have to say for that  she said i did what i had to do as a mother i 'm still waiting for an apology by the way <unk>  then i got married  and once again fgm is like the gift that keeps giving <unk> you figure that out very soon sex was very painful <unk> it hurt all the time and of course i i am the lucky girl it affects every area of your life and this happened to me because i was born a girl in the wrong place <unk>  that 's why it happened to me <unk>  i channel all that anger <unk> all that pain into advocacy because i needed my pain to be worth something  so i 'm the director of an organization called no fgm australia <unk> you heard me right why no fgm <unk> australia fgm is in australia  two days ago i had to call child protective services because somewhere in australia <unk> couple of months ago i met a lady who is married to a malaysian man  her husband came home one day and said he was going to take their daughters back to malaysia to cut off their clitoris and she said why  he said they were dirty  and she said well you married me he said oh this is my cultural belief  <unk> they then went into a whole discussion where she said to him over my dead body will you do that to my daughters  but imagine if this woman wasn 't aware of what fgm was if they never had that conversation her children would have been flown over to malaysia and they would have come back changed for the rest of their lives do you know the millions of dollars it would take us to deal with an issue like that [ three <unk> in australia are at risk of having fgm performed on them  this is an australian problem people it 's not an african problem it 's not a middle eastern problem <unk> it 's not white it 's not black it has no color <unk> it 's everybody 's problem  fgm is child abuse <unk>  it 's violence against women <unk>  it 's saying that women don 't have a right to sexual pleasure <unk> it says we don 't have a right to our bodies <unk> well i say no to that <unk> what i have to say to that  i am proud to say that i 'm doing my part in ending fgm  what are you going to do there may be a child in your classroom who is at risk of fgm <unk> there may be a patient who comes to your <unk> hospital who is at risk of fgm but this is the reality  that even in our beloved australia the most wonderful place in the world children are being abused because of a culture  culture should not be a defense for child abuse <unk> i want ever single one of you to see fgm as an issue for you  make it personal it could be your daughter your sister your cousin <unk> i can 't fight fgm alone i could try <unk> but i can 't <unk>  so my appeal to you is please join me <unk> sign my petition on <unk> change org and type in khadija my name and it 'll come up and sign it  the aim of that is to get support for fgm victims in australia and to protect little girls growing up here to not have this evil done to them <unk> because every child has a right to pleasure <unk> every child has a right to their bodies being left intact and dammit ever child has a right to a clitoris so please join me in ending this act <unk> my favorite quote is all it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men and <unk> you going to let this evil of female genital mutilation to prevail in australia <unk> i don 't think so so please join me in ensuring that it ends in my generation thank you
