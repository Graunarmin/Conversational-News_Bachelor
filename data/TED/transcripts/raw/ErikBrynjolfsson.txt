 <unk> let 's start the story one hundred and twenty years ago when american factories began to electrify their operations <unk> igniting the <unk> the amazing thing is that productivity did not increase in those factories for thirty years <unk>  thirty years that 's long enough for a generation of managers to retire  you see the first wave of managers simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors <unk>  but they didn 't redesign the factories to take advantage of electricity 's flexibility  it fell to the next generation to invent new work processes <unk> and then productivity soared <unk> soared <unk> often doubling or even tripling in those factories  electricity is an example of a general purpose technology like the steam engine before it  general purpose technologies drive most economic growth <unk> because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations <unk> like lightbulbs and yes <unk> factory redesign  is there a general purpose technology of our era <unk> sure <unk> it 's the computer <unk>  but technology alone is not enough technology is not destiny <unk>  we shape our destiny <unk>  and just as the earlier generations of managers needed to redesign their factories we 're going to need to reinvent our organizations and even our whole economic system  we 're not doing as well at that job as we should be as we 'll see in a moment productivity is <unk> actually doing all right <unk> but it has become decoupled from jobs <unk> and the income of the typical worker is stagnating these troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed as the end of innovation but they are actually the growing pains of what andrew mcafee and i call the new machine age  let 's look at some data <unk>  so here 's gdp per person in america  there 's some bumps along the way <unk> but the big story is you could practically fit a ruler to it  this is a log scale so what looks like steady growth is actually an acceleration in real terms <unk> and here 's productivity  you can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid  <unk> but it matches up pretty well with the second industrial revolution when factories were learning how to electrify their operations <unk> after a lag productivity accelerated again  so maybe history doesn 't repeat itself <unk> but sometimes it rhymes  today productivity is at an all time high <unk> and despite the great recession <unk> it grew faster in the <unk> 2000s than it did in the <unk> growing faster than it did during the second industrial revolution <unk> and that 's just the united states <unk> the global news is even better worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate in the past decade than ever in history <unk>  if anything all these numbers actually understate our progress <unk> because the new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just physical production it 's mind <unk> not matter brain not brawn ideas not things  that creates a problem for standard metrics because we 're getting more and more stuff for free  like wikipedia <unk> google skype <unk> and if they post it on the web even this ted talk now getting stuff for free is a good thing right <unk> sure of <unk> that 's not how economists measure gdp zero price means zero weight in the gdp statistics  according to the numbers the music industry is half the size that it was ten years ago <unk>  but i 'm listening to more and better music than ever you know i bet you are too  in total my research estimates that the gdp numbers miss over three hundred billion dollars per year in free goods and <unk> services on the internet  now let 's look to the future there are some super smart people who are arguing that we 've reached the end of growth <unk>  but to understand the future of growth <unk> we need to make predictions about the underlying drivers of <unk> i 'm optimistic <unk> because the new machine age is digital <unk> exponential and combinatorial <unk> when goods are digital they can be replicated with perfect quality at nearly zero cost <unk> and they can be delivered almost instantaneously <unk> welcome to the economics of abundance <unk>  but there 's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress in the age of big data <unk> we can measure the world in ways we never could before <unk>  secondly the new machine age is exponential  computers get better faster than anything else ever a child 's playstation <unk> but our brains are wired for a linear world as a result exponential trends take us by surprise  i used to teach my students that there are some things you know computers just aren 't good at like driving a car through traffic  that 's right <unk> here 's andy and me grinning like madmen because we just rode down route one hundred and one in yes a driverless car thirdly the new machine age is combinatorial <unk> the stagnationist view is that ideas get used up like low hanging fruit <unk>  but the reality is that each innovation creates building blocks for even more innovations <unk> here 's an example  in just a matter of a few weeks an undergraduate student of mine built an app that ultimately reached one point three million users <unk> users  he was able to do that so easily because he built it on top of facebook <unk> and facebook was built on top of the web <unk> and that was built on top of the internet and so on and so forth  now individually digital <unk>  exponential and combinatorial would each be game changers put them together <unk> and we 're seeing a wave of astonishing <unk> like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah or leap tall buildings in a single bound you know robots are even revolutionizing cat transportation  laughter but perhaps the most important invention the most important invention is machine learning <unk>  consider one project ibm 's watson these little dots here those are all the champions on the quiz show <unk> jeopardy at first watson wasn 't very good <unk>  but it improved at a rate faster than any human could and shortly after dave ferrucci showed this chart to my class at mit watson beat the world jeopardy champion  at age seven <unk> watson is still kind of in its <unk> its teachers let it surf the internet unsupervised the next day it started answering questions with profanities <unk>  damn  but you know watson is growing up fast it 's being tested for jobs in call centers <unk> and it 's getting them <unk>  it 's applying for legal banking and medical jobs <unk> and getting some of them <unk>  isn 't it ironic that at the very moment we are building intelligent <unk> machines perhaps the most important invention in human history some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating <unk>  like the first two industrial revolutions <unk>  the full implications of the new machine age are going to take at least a century to fully play out <unk>  but they are staggering <unk>  so does that mean we have nothing to worry about  no technology is <unk> not destiny <unk>  productivity is at an all time high <unk> but fewer people now have jobs <unk>  we have created more wealth in the past decade than ever <unk> but for a majority of americans their income has fallen <unk>  this is the great decoupling of productivity from employment of <unk> not surprising that millions of people have become disillusioned by the great decoupling but like too many others they misunderstand its basic causes  technology is racing ahead <unk> but it 's leaving more and more people behind today <unk> we can take a routine job codify it in a set of machine readable instructions <unk> and then replicate it a million times you know i recently overheard a conversation that epitomizes these new economics  this guy says  nah <unk> i don 't use h & r block anymore turbotax does everything that my tax preparer did but it 's faster <unk> cheaper and more accurate  how can a skilled worker compete with a $ thirty nine piece of software she can 't  <unk> millions of americans do have faster <unk> cheaper more accurate tax preparation <unk> and the founders of intuit have done very well for themselves <unk>  but seventeen percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs  that is a microcosm of what 's happening not just in software and services  but in media and music in finance and manufacturing in retailing and trade in short  in every industry  people are racing against the <unk> machine <unk> and many of them are losing that race what can we do to create shared prosperity <unk>  the answer is not to try to slow down technology  instead of racing against the machine we need to learn to race with the machine that is our grand challenge  the new machine age can be dated to a day fifteen years <unk> ago when garry kasparov the world chess champion <unk> played deep blue a supercomputer  the machine won that day <unk> and today a chess program running on a cell phone can beat a human grandmaster <unk>  it got so bad that when he was asked what strategy he would use against a <unk> but today a computer is no longer the world chess champion <unk>  neither is a human because kasparov organized a freestyle tournament where teams of humans and computers could work together <unk> and the winning team had no grandmaster <unk> and it had no supercomputer what they had was better teamwork <unk> and they showed that a team of humans and computers working together could beat any computer or any human working alone racing with the machine beats racing against the machine <unk> technology is not destiny <unk> we shape our destiny
