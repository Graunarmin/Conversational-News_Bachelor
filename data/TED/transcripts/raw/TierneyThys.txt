 <unk> like to start tonight by something completely different <unk> asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment ninety percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean <unk> and it 's where life the title of our seminar tonight it 's where life began <unk> and it 's a lively and a lovely place but we 're rapidly changing the oceans with our not only with our our overfishing our irresponsible fishing  our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland <unk> but also most recently with climate change and steve schneider i 'm sure <unk> will be going into greater detail on this now as we continue to tinker with the oceans  more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we 're creating will be conducive to low energy type of animals like jellyfish and bacteria <unk>  and this might be the kind of seas we 're headed for  now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful <unk> and you 'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the <unk> aquarium on friday <unk> but they sting like hell <unk> and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up about one hundred grams of jellyfish equals four calories <unk> so it may be good for the waistline but it probably won 't keep you satiated for very long <unk> and a sea that 's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn 't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans that is unless you eat jellyfish  and this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there a by the wind sailor <unk>  and that predator is the giant ocean sunfish the mola mola whose primary prey <unk> the guinness world book of records for being the world 's heaviest bony fish it reaches up to almost five thousand pounds on a diet of jellyfish primarily <unk>  and i think it 's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the mola mola its common name is sunfish that its favorite food is the moon jelly <unk> so it 's kind of nice the sun and the moon getting together this way <unk> even if one is eating the other now this is typically how you see see sunfish this is where they get their common name they like to sunbathe <unk> can 't blame them they just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they 're sick or lazy <unk> but that 's a typical behavior they lie out and bask on the surface  <unk> mola mola  is it sounds hawaiian <unk> but it 's actually latin for millstone <unk> and that 's attributable to their roundish very bizarre cut off shape it 's as if as they were growing they just forgot the tail part <unk>  and that 's actually what drew me to the mola in the first place was this terribly bizarre shape <unk>  you know you look at sharks <unk> and they 're streamlined and they 're sleek and you look at tuna <unk> and they 're like torpedoes they just give away their agenda they 're about migration and strength and then you look at the sunfish  and this is just so elegantly mysterious it 's just it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than <unk> so i was just intrigued with what you know  what is this animal 's story <unk>  well as with anything in biology <unk> nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution the mola 's no exception they appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared sixty five million years ago at a time when whales still had legs <unk> and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish <unk> faction oblige me a little kipling esque storytelling here of course evolution is somewhat random and you know about fifty five million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said oh the heck with the coral reefs we 're going to head to the high seas  and <unk> lots of generations lots of tweaking and torquing <unk> and we turn <unk> if you give mother nature enough time that is what she will produce <unk>  they look maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished abridged perhaps but in fact in fact they are the they vie for the top position of the most <unk> fish in the sea right up there with <unk> thing about that that fish has been changed <unk> and in terms of fishes fishes appeared five hundred million years ago <unk> and they 're pretty modern just fifty million years ago so so interestingly <unk> they give away their ancestry as they develop <unk> they start as little eggs <unk>  and they 're in the guinness world book of records again for having the <unk> most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet a single four foot female had three hundred million eggs can carry three hundred million eggs in her ovaries imagine and they get to be over ten feet long imagine what a ten foot one has  and from that little egg <unk> they pass through this spiky <unk> porcupine fish stage <unk> reminiscent of their ancestry and develop this is their little adolescent stage <unk> they school as adolescents and become behemoth loners as adults <unk> that 's a little diver up there in the corner they 're in the guinness world book of records again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world from their little hatching size of their egg into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood they put on six hundred <unk> million times an increase in weight six hundred million now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby  and you had to feed this thing <unk> that would mean that your child you would expect it to gain the weight of six titanics <unk> feed a child like that but we don 't know how fast the molas grow in in the wild but captive growth studies at the monterey bay aquarium one of the first places to have them in captivity they had one that gained eight hundred lbs in fourteen months <unk> i said now that 's a true american <unk> in today 's seas because schooling used to be salvation for fishes but it 's suicide for fishes now but unfortunately molas <unk> even though they don 't school they still get caught in nets as by catch  if we 're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination then we 've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators how they live their lives like the mola <unk> and unfortunately they make up a large portion of the california by catch up to twenty six percent of the drift net and in the mediterranean in the swordfish net fisheries <unk> they make up up to ninety percent so we 've got to figure out how they 're living their lives <unk>  and how do you do that how do you do that with an animal very few places in the world this is an open ocean creature it knows no boundaries it doesn 't go to land how do you get insight how do you <unk> seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets <unk>  well there 's some great new technology that has just recently become available and it 's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals <unk> and it 's pictured right here  that little tag up there <unk> that little tag can <unk> and light intensity which is correlated with time and from that we can get locations <unk>  and it can record this data for up to two years and keep it in that tag release at a pre programmed time <unk> float to the surface <unk> upload all <unk> <unk> that data that whole travelogue to satellite which relays it directly to our computers <unk> and we 've got that whole dataset <unk> and we didn 't even have we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and <unk> so the great thing about the mola is that when we put the tag on them if you look up here that 's streaming off that 's right where we put the tag <unk>  and it just so happens that 's a parasite hanging off the the mola molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites they 're just parasite hotels <unk>  even their parasites have parasites <unk>  i think donne wrote <unk> they have forty genera of parasites <unk> and so we figured just one more parasite won 't be too much of a problem and they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment <unk> they don 't seem to mind <unk> so far <unk>  so what are we trying to find out we 're focusing on the pacific we 're tagging on the california coast and we 're tagging over in taiwan and japan and we 're interested in <unk> how these animals are using the currents using temperature <unk> using the open ocean to live their lives <unk>  we 'd love to tag in monterey monterey is one of the few places in the world where molas come in large numbers  not this time of year it 's more around october <unk> and we 'd love to tag here this is an aerial shot of monterey but unfortunately the molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes molas but in the wrong way <unk> the california sea lion takes <unk> the molas as soon as they come into the bay rips off their fins <unk> fashions them into the ultimate frisbee mola style <unk> and then tosses them back and forth <unk>  and i 'm not exaggerating it is just and sometimes they don 't eat them it 's just spiteful <unk>  and you know  the locals think it 's terrible behavior <unk> it 's just horrible watching this happen day after day the poor little molas coming in getting ripped to shreds so we head down south to san diego not so many california sea lions down there <unk>  and the molas there <unk> you can find them with a spotter plane very easily and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp <unk>  and under those kelps this is why the molas come there because it 's spa time for the molas there <unk> as soon as they get under those rafts of kelp <unk> cleaner fish come  and they come and give the molas you can see they strike this funny little position that says i 'm not threatening but i need a massage  and they 'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head and the fish come up and they just clean clean clean because the <unk> just a smorgasbord of parasites <unk>  and it 's also a great place to go down south because the water 's warmer <unk>  and the molas are kind of friendly down there <unk> i mean what other kind of fish if you approach it right will say okay <unk> scratch me right there  you truly can swim up to a mola they 're very gentle and if you approach them right you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it  so we 've also tagged one part of the pacific we 've gone over to another part of the pacific and we 've tagged in taiwan and we <unk> tagged in japan  and over in these places the molas are caught in set nets that line these countries <unk>  and they 're not thrown back as by catch they 're eaten we were served a nine course meal of mola after we tagged <unk>  well not the one we tagged <unk>  and everything from the kidney to the <unk> to the back bone to the fin muscle to i think that s pretty much the whole fish is eaten <unk>  so the hardest part of tagging now is after you put that tag on you have to wait  months <unk> and you 're just wondering oh i hope the fish is safe i hope i hope it 's going to be able to actually <unk> live its life out during the course that the tag is recording the tags cost three thousand five hundred dollars each <unk>  and then satellite time is another five hundred dollars so you 're like oh i hope the tag is okay <unk> and so the waiting is really the hardest part <unk> i 'm going to show you our latest dataset <unk> and it hasn 't been published <unk> so it 's totally privy information just for ted and in showing looking at this data we 're thinking <unk> oh do these animals do they cross the equator do they go from one side of the pacific to the other <unk> and we found that they kind of are homebodies they 're not big migrators this is their track we deployed the the tag off of tokyo and the mola in one month kind of got into the kuroshio current off of japan and foraged there <unk> and after four months <unk> you know <unk> off of the north part of japan and that 's kind of their home range now that 's important though because if there 's a lot of fishing pressure <unk> that population doesn 't get replenished <unk> so that 's a very important piece of data <unk>  but also what 's important is that they 're not slacker lazy fish they 're super super industrious and this is a day in the life of a mola and if we they 're up and down and up and down and up and down and up and up and down up to forty times a day  as the sun comes up you see in the blue <unk> they start their dive  down and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper little deeper <unk> they plumb the depths down to six hundred meters in temperatures to one degree centigrade <unk>  and this is why you see them on the surface it 's so cold down there <unk> they 've got to come up warm <unk> that solar power <unk> and then plunge back into the depths and go up and down and up and down and they 're hitting a layer down there it 's called the deep scattering layer which a whole variety of food 's in that layer so rather than just being some sunbathing slacker <unk> they 're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through through temperature we see the same <unk> pattern now with these tags we 're seeing a similar pattern for for swordfishes manta rays tunas <unk> a real three dimensional play  this is part of a much larger program called the census of marine life where they 're going to be tagging all over the world and the mola 's going to enter into that and what 's exciting you all travel and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals <unk> and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge <unk> well now with the census of marine life we 'll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore ninety percent of our living space  with local knowledge it 's never it 's really never been a more exciting or a vital time to be a biologist
