 <unk> as a child <unk> i was raised by native hawaiian elders three old women who took care of me while my parents worked <unk>  the year is we 're watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides <unk> it 's a stretch of beach we know so well <unk>  the smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us <unk>  if you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes <unk> you might dismiss them <unk> as poor and simple that would be a mistake  these women are descendants of polynesian navigators <unk> trained in the old ways by their elders <unk> and now they 're passing it on to me  they teach me the names of the winds and the rains of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars there 's a new moon on the horizon <unk> hawaiians say it 's a good night for fishing <unk> they begin to chant <unk> when they finish <unk> they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them <unk> someday the world will be in trouble <unk> people will forget their wisdom <unk>  it will take elders <unk> ' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance you will go far <unk> away  it will sometimes be a lonely road <unk> we will not be there  but you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers <unk>  and you will recognize your ohana <unk> your family <unk>  and it will take all of you <unk> it will take all of you i hold onto all my life because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me  the year is two thousand and seven <unk>  i 'm on a remote island in micronesia satawal is one half mile long by one mile wide <unk> it 's the home of my mentor his name is pius mau piailug mau is a palu a navigator priest he 's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world  there are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island <unk> their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the pacific without the use of instruments <unk> they could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars <unk> the sequence and direction of waves <unk> the flight patterns of certain birds even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy <unk> when western scientists would join mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull it appeared that an old man was going to rest  in fact the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel <unk>  it is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of <unk> mau was in fact <unk> gathering explicit data using his entire body <unk> it 's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old  now science may dismiss this methodology <unk>  but polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel <unk> the palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance  sometimes i 'd be with mau on a cloud covered night and we 'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island <unk> and he would look out <unk>  and then he would say okay we go  he saw that first glint of light he knew what the weather was going to be three <unk> days from now  their achievements <unk> intellectually and scientifically are extraordinary <unk> and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms  we are in such a critical moment of our collective history  they have been <unk> compared to astronauts these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double hulled canoes thousands of miles from a small island  their canoes our rockets their sea our <unk> the wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot this is part of our collective narrative <unk>  it 's humanity 's dna <unk> we cannot afford to lose it  the year is two thousand and ten <unk>  just as the women in hawaii that raised me predicted the world is in trouble  we live in a society bloated with data <unk>  yet starved for wisdom <unk>  we 're connected <unk> an african shaman said your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes  the link between the past and the future is fragile this i know intimately because <unk> even as i travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them  i struggle  i am haunted by the fact that i no longer remember the names of the winds <unk> and the rains <unk>  mau passed away five months ago <unk> but his legacy and lessons live on <unk> sums of knowledge in them  as potent as the micronesian navigators  that are going dismissed that this is a testament to brilliant brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly because when an elder dies a library is burned <unk> and throughout the world libraries are ablaze <unk> i am grateful for the fact that i had a mentor like mau who taught me how to navigate <unk>  and i realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way and this is what he said the island <unk> and what he meant was <unk>  if you are voyaging and far from home  your very survival depends on everyone aboard <unk>  you cannot make the voyage alone you were never meant to this whole notion of every man for himself is completely <unk> always was so in closing i would offer you this  the planet is our canoe and we are the voyagers <unk> true navigation begins in the human heart <unk> it 's the most important map of all together may we journey well
