 <unk> last month the encyclopaedia britannica announced that it is going out of print after two hundred and forty four years <unk> which made me nostalgic because i remember playing a game <unk> with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library back when i was a kid maybe twelve years old <unk> and i wondered if i could update that game not just for modern methods <unk> but for the modern me <unk>  so i tried i went to an online encyclopedia wikipedia <unk> and i entered the term earth you can start anywhere this time i chose earth  and the first rule of the game is pretty simple you just have to read the article until you find something you don 't know and preferably something your dad doesn 't even know and in this case <unk> i quickly found this the furthest point from the center of the earth is not the tip of mount everest like i might have thought <unk> it 's the tip of this mountain mount chimborazo in ecuador  the earth spins of course as it travels around the sun so the earth bulges a little bit around the middle like some earthlings <unk> and even though mount chimborazo isn 't the tallest <unk> one degree away from the equator <unk> it 's riding that bulge and so the summit of chimborazo is the farthest point on earth from the center of the earth <unk> and it is really fun <unk> <unk> to say <unk> so i immediately decided this is going to be the name of the game or my new exclamation you can use it at ted chimborazo right it 's like eureka and bingo had a baby <unk>  <unk> the next rule of the game is also pretty simple you just have to find another term and look that up <unk> now in the old days that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically maybe getting sidetracked that was fun <unk> nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from i can go literally anywhere in the world i think since i was already in ecuador <unk> i just decided to click on the word tropical  <unk> north and the tropic of capricorn in the south that much i knew <unk> but i was surprised to learn this little fact those are not cartographers ' lines like latitude or the borders between nations <unk> they are astronomical phenomena caused by the earth 's tilt and they change <unk> they move they go up they go down in fact <unk> for years the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn have been steadily drifting towards the equator at the rate of about <unk> meters per year <unk> and nobody told me that i didn 't know it chimborazo <unk> so to keep the game going <unk> i just have to find another term and look that one up since i 'm already in the tropics i chose tropical rainforest famous for its diversity <unk> human <unk> <unk> diversity there are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet they 're all over the globe but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests this is the only place you can go nowadays and not get friended <unk> the link that i clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end it mentioned leopards and <unk> and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then coleoptera <unk> out to be beetles <unk> now i clicked on this on purpose but if i 'd somehow gotten here by mistake it does remind me for the band see the beatles for the car see volkswagon beetle but i am here <unk> for beetle beetles this is the most successful order on the planet by far something between twenty and twenty five percent of all life forms on the planet including plants are beetles that means the next time you are in the grocery store take a look at <unk> the four people ahead of you in line statistically one of you is a beetle <unk>  and if it is you  you are astonishingly well adapted there are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums  there are predator beetles that attack other insects and still look pretty cute to us <unk> are beetles that roll little balls of dung great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings  this reminded the ancient egyptians of their god khepri who renews the ball of the sun every morning which is how that dung rolling scarab became <unk> that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the pharaoh tutankhamun beetles i was reminded have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom <unk> fireflies are not flies fireflies are beetles <unk> fireflies are coleoptera <unk> and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well like my next link <unk> the chemical language of pheromones now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex yeah  and the link to aphrodisiac now that 's something that <unk> increases sexual desire possibly chocolate <unk>  there is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine that might be an aphrodisiac <unk>  but as the article mentions because of enzyme breakdown it 's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally so those of you who only eat your chocolate <unk> you might have to experiment the link i clicked on here <unk> mostly because i understand what both of those words mean <unk>  but not when they 're together like that i do like sympathy <unk> i do like magic so when i click on sympathetic magic i get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls this is the boy in me getting lucky again <unk> sympathetic magic is imitation if you imitate something <unk> maybe you can have an effect on it that 's the idea behind voodoo dolls and possibly also cave paintings the link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind i would love to see google maps inside some of these caves  we 've got <unk> artwork common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands <unk> usually the left hand we have been a <unk> for millenia  so even though i don 't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand or blow pigment on it from a tube <unk> i can easily picture how he did it and i really <unk> <unk> don 't think it 's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that i 'm going to use now to click on the term for hand  <unk> hand is formally called the opisthenar <unk>  now that 's embarrassing because up until now every time i 've said i know it like the back of my hand i 've really been saying i 'm totally familiar with that i just don 't know it 's freaking name right  and the link i clicked on here well <unk> lemurs monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar <unk> i click on chimpanzee <unk> i get our closest genetic relative  pan troglodytes the name we give him means cave dweller  he doesn 't he lives in rainforests and savannas <unk> it 's just that we 're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us <unk> and in some cases <unk>  he gets places before us <unk> like my next link the almost irresistible link i click on him and i really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice in fact he 's born in cameroon <unk> which is smack in the middle of my tropics map <unk> and <unk> <unk> more specifically his skeleton wound up in the smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles in between those two landmarks in ham 's life  <unk> months before the first human being to do it <unk> soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin  when i click on yuri gagarin 's page i get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature <unk> huge in heroism <unk> top estimates <unk> soviet estimates put this guy at one point six five meters that is less than five and a half feet tall max possibly because he was malnourished as a child <unk> germans occupied russia a nazi officer <unk> took over the gagarin household <unk> and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut  years later the boy from that cramped mud hut would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space the first one of any of us to really physically <unk> he didn 't just leave it  he circled it once fifty years later as a tribute <unk> the international space station which is still up there tonight <unk>  synced its orbit with gagarin 's orbit at the exact same time of day <unk> and filmed it so you can go online and you can watch over one hundred minutes of what <unk> <unk> must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride possibly a lonely one the first person to ever see such a thing and then when you 've had your fill of that you can click on one more link <unk> you can come back to earth <unk> you return to where you started you can finish your game <unk> you just need to find one more fact that you didn 't know and for me <unk> i quickly landed on this one  the earth has a tolerance of about 17 percent from the reference spheroid which is less than <unk> billiard balls this is the kind of fact i would have loved as a boy i found it myself <unk>  it 's got some math that i can do i 'm pretty sure my dad doesn 't know it <unk>  what this means is that if you could shrink the earth to the size of a billiard ball if you could take planet earth  with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees voodoo dolls fireflies chocolate <unk> sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea <unk> you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball <unk> it would be as smooth as a billiard ball presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle <unk>  that 's pretty cool <unk> i didn 't know that chimborazo
