 <unk> i was informed by this kind of unoriginal and trite idea that new technologies were an opportunity for social transformation which is what drove me then  and still it 's a delusion that drives me now <unk> i wanted to update what i 've been doing since then but it 's still the same theme song and introduce you to my lab and current work which is the environmental health clinic that i run at nyu  and what it is it 's a twist on health because really what i 'm trying to do now is redefine what counts as health it 's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university <unk>  except people come to the clinic with environmental health concerns and they walk out with prescriptions for things they can do to improve <unk> environmental health as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals  it 's a handy dandy quote from hippocrates of the hippocratic oath that says the greater part of the soul lays outside the body treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer but that suggests the the issue that i 'm trying to get at here that we have an <unk> opportunity to redefine what is health because this idea that health is internal and atomized and individual and pharmaceutical is largely an error and i would use this study a recent study by philip landrigan  to motivate a different view of health where he went to most of the pediatricians in manhattan and the new york area and logged what they spent their patient hours on eighty to ninety percent of their time was spent on five things <unk> one was asthma <unk> number two was developmental delays <unk> number three was 400 fold increases in rare childhood cancers in the last eight to ten fifteen years number four and five were childhood obesity and <unk> diabetes related issues <unk> so all of those what 's common about all of those <unk>  <unk> the environment is implicated radically implicated right this is not the germs that medicos were trained to deal with this is a different definition of health health that has a great advantage because it 's external <unk> it 's shared <unk> we can do something about it as opposed to internal genetically predetermined or individualized people who come to the clinic are called <unk> because they 're too impatient to wait for legislative change to address local and environmental health issues <unk>  and i meet them at the university i also have a few field offices that i set up in various places that provide an immersion in some of the environmental challenges we face i like this one from the belgian field office <unk>  where we met in a roundabout precisely because the roundabout iconified the headless social movement that informs much social transformation as opposed to the <unk> top down control of red light traffic intersections in this case of course the roundabout with that micro decisions being made in situ by people not being told what to do  but of course affords greater throughput fewer accidents <unk>  and an an interesting model of social movement  some of the things that <unk> the monitoring protocols have developed this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol or keeping tabs  if you will what they are is an addition of tadpoles that are named after a local bureaucrat whose decisions affect your water quality so an impatient concerned for water quality would raise a tadpole bureaucrat in a sample of water <unk> in which they 're interested and we give them a couple of things to do that to help them do companion animal devices while they 're blogging and doing their email <unk> this is a <unk> tadpole walker to take your tadpole walking in the evening  and the interesting thing that happens because we 're using tadpoles of course <unk> because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have several orders of magnitude more sensitive than some of our senses for for sensing <unk> responding in a biologically meaningful way to that whole class of industrial contaminants we call endocrine disruptors or hormone <unk> emulators <unk> but by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening there 's a few action shots your neighbors are likely to say what are you doing and then you have to introduce your tadpole and who it 's named after you have to explain what you 're doing and how the developmental events of a tadpole are of course very <unk> next time your neighbor sees you they 'll say how is that tadpole doing and you can let them social network with your tadpole because the environmental health clinic has a social networking site for not only impatients <unk> humans but non humans social networking for humans and non humans and of course <unk> these endocrine disruptors are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic the obesity epidemic <unk>  the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls and other related things the culmination of this is if you 've successfully raised your tadpole observing the behavioral and developmental events you will then go and introduce your tadpole to its namesake and discuss the evidence that you 've seen another quick protocol and i 'm going to go through these quickly but just to give you the material sense of <unk> what we 're doing here instead of asking you for urine samples i 'll ask you for a mouse sample anyone here lucky enough to share to cohabit with a mouse a domestic partnership with mice  very lucky mice of course are the quintessential model organism <unk> they 're even better models of environmental health because not only the same mammalian biology but they share your diet largely they share <unk> share your environmental stressors the asbestos levels and lead levels whatever you 're exposed to and they 're geographically more limited than you are because we don 't know if you 've been exposed to persistent organic pollutants in your home or occupationally or as a child mice are a very good representation so it starts by building a better mousetrap of course this is one of them <unk> coping with environmental stressors is tricky <unk> is anybody here on antidepressants  there 's a lot of people in manhattan are and we were testing if the mice would also <unk> so this was prozac this was zoloft this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant all of which were the medications that the <unk> how did you know that <unk> they did this was vodka and solution gin and solution <unk> this guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant <unk> water which was interesting then of course it goes into the entrapment device there 's an old cellphone in there a good use for old cellphones which dials the clinic we go and pick up the mouse  we take the blood sample and do the blood work and hair work on the mice <unk> and i want to sort of point out the big advantage of framing health in this external way <unk> but we do have a few prescription <unk> different from the medical model anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality or to understand it or to change it <unk> the benefits are enjoyed by anyone you share that water quality or air quality with and that aggregating effect that collective action effect is actually something we can use to our advantage so i want to show you one prescription product in the clinic called the no park <unk> this is a prescription to <unk> improve water quality <unk> many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality what we do is we take a fire hydrant a no parking space associated with a fire hydrant <unk> and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt to create an engineered micro landscape  to create an infiltration opportunity <unk> because many of you will know that the biggest pollution burden that we have on the new york new jersey harbor right now is no longer the point sources polluters no longer the ges but that massive network of roads [ those ] impervious surfaces that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners or the oily <unk> <unk> hydrocarbon waste in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure washes it straight into the estuary system that <unk> produced by impatients on various city blocks in some very interesting ways i just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though there 's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block by creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them we don 't prevent them from being used as emergency vehicle parking spaces because of course a firetruck can come and park there they flatten a few plants no big deal but if we did this in every single every fire hydrant we could redefine the emergency that <unk> <unk> percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there it 's infiltrating pollutants <unk> it 's also increasing <unk> these smaller interceptions could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution that now runs into the estuary system up to a seven inch rain event up to a hundred year storm <unk>  so these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health this is one of the more ambitious ones <unk> what the climate crisis has revealed to us is a secondary more insidious and more pervasive crisis which is the crisis of agency <unk> which is what to do somehow buying a local lettuce changing a light bulb <unk>  driving the speed limit <unk> changing your tires regularly doesn 't seem sufficient in the face of climate crisis and this is an interesting icon that happened you remember these fallout shelters <unk> fallout shelter for the climate crisis <unk>  this was civic mobilization churches school groups hospitals <unk> private residents everyone built one of these in a matter of months <unk>  and they still remain as icons of civic response in the face of shared uncertain collective threat <unk> fallout shelter for the climate crisis i would say looks something like this  or this which is an intensive urban agriculture facility that 's due to go on my lab building at nyu what it does is a very simple idea of taking eighty to ninety percent of the co2 produced in manhattan is building related we take just like a commercial greenhouse we take the co2 from the building co2 enriched air we force it through the urban agriculture facility and then we resupply you can 't actually build much on a roof they 're not designed for that so it 's on legs <unk>  so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns  it 's built as a barn raising using open source hardware <unk> this is the <unk> quarter scale prototype that was functioning in spain this is what it will look like fingers crossed nyu willing <unk> and what i want to show you is actually this is one of the components of it that we 've just recently been testing <unk> which is a solar chimney we have got seventeen of them now put around new york at the moment that passively draws air up you understand a solar chimney <unk> hot air rises you put a bit of black <unk> <unk> plastic on the side of a building it 'll heat up and you 'll get passive airflow what we do is actually put <unk> ozone is responsible for about half of global warming 's effects because it changes it settles on the snow it changes the reflectors it changes the the transmission qualities of the atmosphere  carbon black is that grime that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs and it 's associated with <unk> it 's not good stuff and it 's from <unk> when we put it through our solar chimney we remove actually about ninety five percent of that and then i swap it out with the students and actually re release that carbon black and we make pencils the length of which measures the grime that we 've pulled out of the air here 's one of them that we have up now here 's who put them up and who are avid pencil users <unk> okay so i want to show you just two more interfaces <unk> because i think one of our big challenges is re imagining our relationship to natural systems not only through this model of of twisted personalized health <unk> but through the animals with whom we cohabit  we are not alone the animals are moving in in fact urban migration now describes the movement of animals formerly known as wild into urban centers <unk> park a whale in the gowanus canal <unk> elk in westchester county <unk> it 's happening all over the developed world probably for loss of habitat but also because our cities are a little bit more livable than they have been and every green space we create is an invitation for non humans to cohabit with us but we 've kind of lacked imagination in how we could do that well or interestingly <unk> <unk> and i want to show you a few of the technological interfaces that have been developed under the moniker of ooz which is zoo backwards and without cages to try and that relationship this is communication technology for birds it looks like this when a bird lands on it they trigger a sound file <unk> this is actually in the whitney museum where there were six of them <unk> each of which had a different argument on it  different sound file <unk> health food bars the ones you call bird food and bring it here and scatter it around there 's a good person natalie jeremijenko okay  so there was several of these the birds were able to jump from one to the other these are just your average urban pigeon elicited cooperative behavior from the people below about a hundred to one decided that this was the argument that worked best on us recorded voice tick tick tick that 's the sound of genetic mutations of the avian flu becoming a deadly human flu do you know what slows it down <unk> biodiversity generally  it is in your interests that i 'm healthy <unk> happy  well fed hence you could share some of your nutritional resources instead of monopolizing them  that is share your lunch <unk> it 's actually officially launched next week with a wonderful commission from the architectural league you may not have known that you need to communicate with fish but there is now a device for you to do so it looks like this <unk> buoys that float on the water project three foot up three foot down when a fish swims underneath a light goes on <unk> this is what it looks like <unk> there 's another function on here this top light is i 'm sorry if i 'm making you seasick this top light is actually a water quality display that shifts from red when the dissolved oxygen is low to a blue <unk> green when its dissolved oxygen is high <unk>  and then you can also text the fish <unk> so there 's business cards down there that 'll give you contact details and they text back <unk> when the buoys get your text they wink at you twice <unk> to say we 've got your message <unk> but perhaps the most popular has been that we 've got another array of these boys in the bronx river <unk> where the first beaver crazy as he is to have moved in and built a lodge in new york in two hundred and fifty years hangs out so updates from a beaver you can subscribe to updates from him you can talk to him and what i like to think of is this is an interface how we interact with natural systems specifically by changing who has information <unk> where they have it who can make sense of that information <unk>  and what you can do about it  in this case <unk> instead of throwing chewing gum or doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish there 's a body of water in <unk> been dealing with that 's in the middle of the city and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution it 's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds <unk> instead of doing that actually we 've developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish <unk> they 're delicious <unk> delicious that is delicious for humans and non humans but they also have a chelating agent in them  <unk> they 're nutritionally appropriate not like doritos and so every time that desire to interact with the animals which is is <unk> at least as ubiquitous as that sign do not feed the animals and there 's about three of them on every new york city park and yellowstone national park there 's more do not feed the animals signs than there are animals you might wish to feed <unk> changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent which like any chelating agent that we use medicinally  binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and pcbs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt where it 's complexed by a reactive effectively removing it from bioavailability  but i wanted to say that that interaction re scripting that interaction into collective action collective remediative action <unk>  very different from the approach that 's being used on the other side on the <unk> where we 're dredging the pcbs after thirty years of legislative and legal struggle <unk> ge 's paying for the dredging of the the largest superfund site in the world we 're dredging it and it 'll probably get shipped off to pennsylvania or the nearest third world country <unk> where it will continue to be toxic sludge <unk> displacement is not the way to deal with environmental <unk> and that 's typically the paradigm under which we we 've operated by actually taking the opportunity that new technologies new interactive technologies present to re script our interactions  to script them not just as isolated individuated interactions but as collective aggregating actions that can amount to something we can really begin to address some of our important environmental challenges thank you
