 <unk> this theater is built on copacabana  which is the most famous beach in the world but twenty five kilometers away from here in the north zone of rio lies a community called vila cruzeiro <unk> and roughly sixty thousand people live there now the people here in rio mostly know vila cruzeiro from the news and unfortunately news from vila cruzeiro often is not good news <unk>  but vila cruzeiro is also the place where our story begins jeroen koolhaas  ten years ago <unk> we first came to rio to shoot a documentary about life in the favelas  now we learned that favelas are informal communities they emerged over the years when immigrants <unk> from the countryside came to the cities looking for work like cities within the cities  known for problems like crime <unk> poverty <unk> and the violent drug war between police and the drug gangs <unk>  so what struck us was that these were communities that the people who lived there had built with their own hands without a master plan and like a giant work in progress  where we 're from in holland <unk> is planned we even have rules for how to follow the rules du  so the last day of filming we ended up in vila cruzeiro and we were sitting down and we had a drink <unk> and we were overlooking this hill with all these houses and most <unk> <unk> of these houses looked unfinished <unk> and they had walls of bare brick <unk> but we saw some of these <unk> were plastered and painted <unk> and suddenly we had this idea <unk> what would it look like if all these houses would be plastered and painted <unk>  and then we imagined one big design one big work of art <unk> who would expect something like that in a place like this <unk>  so we thought would that even be possible so first we started to count the houses but we soon <unk> we had a friend he ran an ngo in vila cruzeiro his name was nanko and he also liked the idea  he said you know everybody here would pretty much love to have their houses plastered and painted it 's when a house is finished  so he introduced us to the right people and vitor and <unk> maurinho became our crew <unk>  we picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here we made a few designs <unk> and everybody liked this design of a boy flying a kite the best so we started painting and the first thing we did was to paint everything blue <unk>  and we thought that looked already pretty good  but they hated it the people who lived there really hated it they said what did you do you painted our house in exactly the same color as the police station  in a favela that is not a good thing also the same color as the prison cell so we quickly went ahead and we painted the boy <unk>  and then we thought we were finished we were really happy <unk>  but still it wasn 't good because the little kids started coming up to us and they said you know there 's a boy flying the kite but where is his kite  we said uh it 's art <unk> you know you have to imagine the kite <unk> we quickly installed a kite way up high on the hill so that you could see the boy flying the kite and you could actually see a kite <unk>  so the local news started writing about it which was great <unk> and then even the guardian wrote about it notorious slum becomes <unk> so encouraged by this success we went back to rio for a second project <unk> and we stumbled upon this street <unk> it was covered in concrete to prevent mudslides <unk> and somehow we saw a sort of river in it <unk> and we imagined this river to be a river in japanese style with koi carp swimming upstream <unk> so we decided to paint that river <unk>  and we invited rob admiraal who is a tattoo artist <unk> and he specialized in the japanese style  so little did we know that we would spend almost an entire <unk> year painting that river together with geovani and robinho and vitor who lived nearby <unk>  and we even moved into the neighborhood when one of the guys that lived on the street <unk> elias <unk> told us that we could come and live in his house together with his family which was fantastic  unfortunately during that time <unk> another war broke out between the police and the drug gangs we learned that during those times people in communities really stick together during these times <unk> but we also learned a very important element the importance of barbecues  laughter because when you throw a barbecue it turns you from a guest into a host <unk>  so we decided to throw one almost every other week <unk> and we got to know everybody in the neighborhood jk  we still had this idea of the hill though du yeah yeah we were talking about the scale of this because this painting was incredibly big and it was <unk> drove us completely insane ourselves <unk>  but we figured that maybe during this process all the time that we had spent in the neighborhood was maybe actually even more important than the painting itself jk  so after all that time this hill this idea was still there and we started to make sketches <unk> models <unk>  and we figured something out we figured that our ideas our designs had to be a little bit more <unk> simple than that last project so that we could paint with more people and cover more houses at the same time <unk> and we had an opportunity to try that out in a community in the central part of rio which is called santa marta <unk> and we made a design for this place which looked like this <unk> and then we got people to go along with it because turns out that if your idea is ridiculously big it 's easier to get <unk> people to go along with this and the people of santa marta got together and in a little over a month they turned that square into this  and this image somehow went all over the <unk> so then we received an unexpected phone call from the philadelphia mural arts program <unk> and they had this question if this idea our approach if this would actually work in north philly <unk> which is one of the poorest neighborhoods in the united states <unk>  so we immediately said yes we had no idea how but it seemed like a very <unk> so we did exactly the same as we did in rio <unk> and we moved into the neighborhood and started barbecuing  so the project took almost two years to complete <unk> and we made individual designs for every single house on the avenue that we painted <unk> and we made these designs together with the local store owners the building owners <unk> and a team of about a dozen young men and women they were hired <unk> hired <unk> and then they were trained as painters <unk>  and together they transformed their own neighborhood the whole street into a giant patchwork of color  and at the end the city of philadelphia thanked every single one of them and gave them a merit for their <unk> accomplishment jk so now we had painted a whole street <unk> how about we do this whole hill now  we started looking for funding <unk> but instead we just ran into questions <unk>  like how many houses are you going to paint  how many square meters is that how much paint are you going <unk> how many people are you going to employ <unk> and we we did try for years to write plans for the funding and answer all those questions <unk>  but then we thought in order to answer all those questions you have to know exactly what you 're going to do before you actually get there and start <unk>  and maybe it 's a mistake to think like that  it would lose some of the magic that we had learned about that if you go somewhere and you spend time there  you can let the project grow organically <unk> and have a life of its own du  so what we did is we decided to take this plan and strip it away from all the numbers and all the ideas and presumptions and just go back to the base idea which was to transform this hill into a giant work of art and instead of looking for funding we started a crowdfunding campaign <unk> and in a little over a month more than one thousand five hundred people put together and donated over one hundred thousand dollars <unk>  so for us this was an amazing moment because now  because now we we finally had the freedom to use all the lessons that we had learned and create a project that was built the same way that the favela was built from the ground on up bottom up with no master plan jk  so we went back and we employed angelo <unk> and he 's a local artist from vila cruzeiro very talented guy and he knows almost everybody there and then we employed elias our former landlord who invited us into his house and he 's a master of construction  together with them we decided where to start <unk> we picked this spot in vila cruzeiro <unk> and houses are being plastered as we speak good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next they 're even printing t shirts they 're putting up banners explaining everything to everybody  and talking to the press  this article about angelo appeared du so while this is happening we are bringing this idea all over the world <unk> so  like the project we did in philadelphia we are also invited to do workshops for instance in curaao and right now we 're planning a <unk> huge project in haiti jk  so the favela was not only the place where this idea started it was also the place that made it possible to work without a master plan because these communities are informal this was the inspiration and in a communal effort together with the people  you can almost work like in an orchestra where you can have a hundred instruments playing together to create a symphony <unk> so we want to thank everybody who wanted to become part of this dream and supported us along the way <unk> and we are looking at continuing jk yeah <unk> and so one day pretty soon when the colors start going up on these walls we hope more people will join us and join this big dream and maybe one day the whole of vila cruzeiro will be painted
