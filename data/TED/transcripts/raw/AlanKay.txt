 <unk> way to start i think with my view of simplicity is to take a look at ted here you are understanding why we 're here what 's going on with no difficulty at all the best a i in the planet would find it <unk> complex and confusing <unk> and my little dog watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point  he would have a great time <unk> and of course if you 're a speaker here like hans rosling a speaker finds this complex tricky <unk> but in hans rosling 's case <unk> he had a secret weapon yesterday literally in his sword swallowing act <unk> and i must say i thought of quite a few objects that i might try to swallow today and finally gave up on but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing so puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense but that we 're easily fooled in fact what <unk> shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled <unk> so we 're actually looking forward to it  we go to magic shows in order to be fooled <unk> and this makes many things fun <unk> but it makes it difficult to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves and our friend betty edwards the drawing on the <unk> right side of the brain lady shows these two tables to her drawing class and says the problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can 't move your hand but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty it 's trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what 's there and to prove it she says <unk> size and shape of these tabletops is the same <unk> and i 'm going to prove it to you she does this with cardboard but since i have an expensive computer here i 'll just rotate this little guy around and  now having seen that and i 've seen it hundreds of times because i use this in every talk i give i still can <unk> that they 're the same size and shape and i doubt that you can either <unk> so what do artists do well what artists do is to measure  they measure very very carefully and if you measure very very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge you 'll see that those two shapes are exactly the same <unk> the talmud saw this a long time ago <unk> saying we see things not as they are but as we are i certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight back then if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion  so if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here it 's a waking <unk> dream <unk> and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history <unk>  and what that means simple and understandable might not be actually simple or understandable and things we think are complex might be made simple and understandable somehow we have to understand ourselves to get <unk> around our flaws we can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel  the way i think of it is we can 't learn to see until we admit we 're blind once you start down at this very humble level then you can start finding ways to see things and what 's happened over the last four hundred years in particular is that human beings have invented little additional parts for our brain made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways and these are in the form of sensory apparatus telescopes microscopes reasoning apparatus various ways of thinking and most importantly in the ability to change perspective on things i 'll talk about that a little bit it 's this change in perspective on what it is we think we 're perceiving that has helped us make more progress in the last four hundred years than we have in the rest of human history <unk> and yet  it is not taught in any k through twelve curriculum in america that i 'm aware of  <unk> the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more  we like more if we do more in a kind of a stupid way the simplicity gets complex and in fact <unk> we can keep on doing it for a very long time <unk>  but murray gell mann yesterday talked about emergent properties <unk> another name for them could be architecture as a metaphor <unk> taking the same old material and thinking about <unk> ways of combining it and in fact <unk> what murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar all goes down to the <unk> the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish <unk> and they 're in violent motion those three things give rise to all the different levels of what seem to be complexity in our world <unk> a few years ago i just thought it was the greatest thing i 'd seen in conveying complex ideas simply but then i had a thought of boy maybe it 's too simple and i put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the <unk> side and i found that they matched up very well <unk> so the roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing what 's important about the data <unk> whereas the the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell as a former molecular biologist <unk> i didn 't like that at all not because it wasn 't beautiful or anything but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology and that is why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed  and what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous <unk> they just swooped in the air and bound <unk> something happened <unk>  but in fact those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second  they 're agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds they 're completely crowded together they 're jammed they 're bashing up against each other <unk> and if you don 't understand that in your mental model of this stuff  what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous and i think that 's exactly the wrong image for when you 're trying to teach science <unk>  so another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle <unk> so a kid who 's fourteen in high school gets this version of the pythagorean theorem <unk> which is a truly subtle and interesting proof <unk> but in fact it 's not a good way to start learning about mathematics so a more direct one one that gives you more of the feeling of math <unk> is something closer to pythagoras <unk> ' own proof which goes like this so here we have this triangle and if we surround that c square with three more triangles and we copy that notice that we can move those triangles down like this and that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious <unk>  and bingo <unk> <unk> that is all you have to do <unk> and this kind of proof is the kind of proof that you need to learn when you 're learning mathematics in order to get an idea of what it means before you look into the literally <unk> <unk> hundred or one thousand five hundred proofs of pythagoras ' theorem that have been discovered  now let 's go to young children this is a very unusual teacher who was a kindergarten and <unk> teacher but was a natural mathematician <unk> so she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician she just had a feeling for math <unk> and here are her six year olds and she 's got them making shapes out of a shape so they pick a shape they like <unk> like a diamond or a square or a triangle or a trapezoid and then they try and make the next larger shape of that same shape and the next larger shape you can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there and what this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project and then something like science so they had created these artifacts now she had <unk> them look at them and do this laborious <unk> which i thought for a long time until she explained to me was to slow them down so they 'll think so they 're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up but the whole point of this thing is for them to look at this chart and fill it out what have you noticed about what you did <unk> lauren there noticed that the first one took one and the second one took three more and the total was four on that one the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one and then the next one <unk> she saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by <unk> so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there and she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six  where she wasn 't sure what six times six was and what seven times seven was but then she was confident again <unk> so that 's what lauren did and then the teacher <unk> gillian ishijima had the kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor and everybody went batshit <unk> shit <unk> they 're the same no matter what the shapes were the growth law is the same <unk> and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first order discrete differential equation and a second order discrete differential equation <unk> what we usually try to teach six year olds so let 's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this and so the first first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do i 'm using the software that we 're putting on the $ one hundred laptop <unk> so i 'd like to draw a little car here i 'll just do this very quickly and put a big tire on him and i get a little object here and i can look inside this object i 'll call it a car and here <unk> little behavior car forward each time i click it car turn if i want to make a little script to do this over and over again i just drag these guys out and set them going <unk>  and i can try steering the car here by see the car turn by five here <unk> so what if i click this down to zero it goes straight that 's a big revelation for nine year olds make it go in the other direction <unk> but of course that 's a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car so the kids want to do a steering wheel <unk> so they draw a steering wheel  and we 'll call this a wheel <unk> <unk> this wheel 's heading here if i turn this wheel you can see that number over there going minus and positive  that 's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out there and to just drop it into the script here and now i can steer the car with the steering wheel and it 's interesting you know how much trouble the children have with <unk> but by learning it this way in a situated fashion they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it  and we can reflect here the way gillian ishijima did so if you look at the little script here the speed is always going to be thirty we 're going to move the car according to that over and over again <unk>  and i 'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things they 're evenly spaced because they 're thirty apart <unk>  and what if i do this progression that the <unk> six year olds did of saying ok <unk> i 'm going to increase the speed by two each time  and then i 'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time what do i get there  we get a visual pattern of what these nine year olds called acceleration <unk> so how do the children do science <unk> not pay any attention to what anybody else is <unk> putting on <unk> aristotle never asked a child about this particular point because of course he didn 't bother doing the experiment and neither did <unk> st thomas aquinas and it was not until galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child only four hundred <unk> years ago <unk> we get one child like that about every classroom of thirty kids who will actually cut straight to the chase now what if we want to look at this more closely <unk> we can take a movie of what 's going on but even if we single stepped this movie it 's tricky to see what 's going on <unk>  and so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up <unk>  so when the children see <unk> this they say ah acceleration  remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways <unk> and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is  so what i 'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image about a fifth of a second later  like that and they 're getting <unk> faster and faster each time and if i stack these guys up  then we see the differences <unk> the increase in the speed is constant and they say oh yeah constant acceleration we 've done that already <unk> how shall we look and verify that we actually have it so you can 't tell much from just making the ball drop there <unk> but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time <unk>  we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model  galileo by the <unk> did this very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute  i pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that this is actually probably a newton and the apple type story but it 's a great story <unk> and i thought i would do just one thing on the $ one hundred laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here <unk> so once you have gravity here 's this increase the speed by something increase the ship 's speed if i start the little game here that the kids have done it 'll crash the space ship  but if i oppose gravity here we go
