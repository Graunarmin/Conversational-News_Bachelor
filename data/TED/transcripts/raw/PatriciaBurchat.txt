 <unk> as a particle physicist <unk> i study the elementary particles and how they interact on the most fundamental level  for most of my research career i 've been using accelerators such as the electron accelerator at stanford university just up the road <unk> to study things on the smallest scale <unk>  but more recently <unk> i 've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale <unk> because as i 'll explain to you the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected <unk> so i 'm going to tell you about our twenty first century view of the universe <unk>  what it 's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are at least some of the big questions  so  <unk> we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe and by ordinary matter <unk> i mean you me the planets the stars the galaxies the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe <unk>  almost a quarter or approximately a quarter of the matter in the universe is stuff that 's invisible  by invisible i mean it doesn 't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum <unk> it doesn 't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum it doesn 't reflect it doesn 't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum which is what we <unk> use to detect things it doesn 't interact at all so how do we know it 's there we know it 's there by its gravitational effects in fact this dark matter dominates the gravitational <unk> <unk> effects in the universe on a large scale and i 'll be telling you about the evidence for that what about the rest of the pie  <unk> matter in these galaxies especially in a spiral galaxy like this most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy <unk>  this huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy <unk> so we have these stars going around in circles like this as you can imagine even if you know physics <unk> this should be intuitive ok that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here <unk> <unk> ok <unk> so what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside  <unk> when those measurements are made instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant as a function of distance  if it 's constant that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see  in fact this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter and this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves <unk> and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy <unk> so we see the galaxy and fixate on that but it 's actually a cloud of dark matter that 's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy <unk>  galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space they tend to cluster and this is an example of a very actually famous cluster the coma cluster and there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster <unk> fuzzy elliptical things here so these galaxy clusters we take a snapshot now <unk> we take a snapshot in a decade it 'll look identical but these galaxies are actually moving at extremely <unk> <unk> high speeds they 're moving around in in this gravitational potential well of this cluster ok so all of these galaxies are moving we can measure the speeds <unk> of these galaxies their orbital velocities and figure out how much mass is in this cluster and again what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be <unk> <unk> accounted for by the galaxies that we see or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum we see that there 's a lot of gas in this cluster as well <unk> but that cannot account for the mass either in fact <unk> there appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter it would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly i 'm just putting this big blue blob on there ok to try to remind you that it 's there  can we see it more visually yes we can and so let me lead you through how we can do this so here 's an observer it could be an eye it could be a telescope and suppose there 's a galaxy out here in the universe how do we see <unk> a ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters the telescope or your eye <unk> now how do we deduce where the galaxy is well we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling as it enters our eye <unk> right <unk> we say the ray of light came this way the galaxy must be there <unk> ok <unk>  now <unk> suppose i put in the middle a cluster of galaxies and don 't forget the dark matter ok <unk> now <unk> if we consider a different ray of light one <unk> going off like this we now need to take into account what einstein predicted when he developed general relativity <unk> and that was that the gravitational field due to mass  will deflect not only the trajectory of particles but will deflect light itself so this light ray will not continue in a straight line <unk> but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye <unk>  where will this observer see <unk> the galaxy <unk> you can respond  up right <unk> we extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer 's eye from that galaxy <unk>  yes <unk> great i see people going down like this <unk> so a ray of light could go down be bent up into the observer 's eye <unk> and the observer sees a ray of light here  now take into account the fact that we live in a ok a three dimensional space are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye <unk>  yes <unk> the rays would lie on a i 'd like to see yeah on a a cone so there 's a whole ray of light rays of light on a cone that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer 's eye <unk> if there is a cone of light coming into <unk> what do i see  a circle a ring it 's called an einstein ring <unk> einstein predicted that <unk> ok <unk> now it will only be a perfect ring if the source <unk>  the deflector and the eyeball in this case are all in a perfectly straight line  if they 're slightly skewed we 'll see a different image now you can do an experiment tonight over the reception ok  to figure out what that image will look <unk> because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect we call this gravitational lensing <unk>  and so this is your instrument <unk> ok  but ignore the top part it 's the base that i want you to concentrate <unk>  ok <unk> so actually at home whenever we break a wineglass i save the bottom <unk> take it over to the machine shop we shave it off and i have a little gravitational lens ok so it 's got the right shape to produce the lensing and so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin <unk> i grabbed a piece of graph paper i 'm a physicist so  a napkin <unk>  draw a little model galaxy in the middle  and now put the lens over the galaxy and what you 'll find is that you 'll see a ring an einstein ring now move the base off to the side and the ring will split up into arcs ok and you can put it on top of any image on the graph paper <unk> can see how all the the lines on the graph paper have been distorted and again <unk> this is a kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gravitational lensing <unk>  ok <unk> so the question is do we see this in the sky do we see arcs in the sky when we look at say a cluster of galaxies and the answer is yes <unk> and so here 's an image from the hubble space telescope many of the images you are seeing are earlier from the hubble space telescope well first of all for the golden shape <unk> galaxies those are the galaxies in the cluster they 're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter that are causing the bending of the light to cause these optical <unk> <unk> illusions or mirages <unk> practically of the background galaxies so the streaks that you see all these streaks  <unk> so what we can do then is based on how much distortion we see in those images we can calculate how much mass there must be in this cluster and it 's an enormous amount of mass and also <unk> you can tell by eye by looking at this that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies <unk> they are centered on some <unk> in which the cluster is embedded ok <unk> so this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye  ok so a quick review then to see that you 're following <unk> so the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter this gravitationally attracting stuff is that galaxies the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large it must be embedded in dark matter <unk> the speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large it must be embedded in dark matter and we see these gravitational lensing effects these distortions that say that again <unk> clusters are embedded in dark matter <unk>  ok so now let 's turn to dark energy <unk>  so to understand the evidence for dark energy <unk> we need to discuss something that stephen hawking referred to in the previous session and that is the fact that space itself is expanding  so if we imagine <unk> a section of our infinite universe and so i 've put down four spiral galaxies ok and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure horizontal or vertical for measuring where things are  if you could do this what you would find that with each passing <unk> each passing year each passing billions of years ok the distance between galaxies is getting greater <unk>  and it 's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space they 're not necessarily moving through space they 're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger ok that 's what the expansion of the universe or space means so they 're moving further apart now <unk> what stephen hawking mentioned as well is that after the big bang space expanded at a very rapid rate but because gravitationally attracting matter is embedded in this space <unk> it tends to slow down the expansion of the space ok <unk> so the expansion slows down with time  so in the last century ok <unk> people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever <unk> whether it would slow down you know will be slowing down but continue forever slow down and stop <unk> asymptotically stop <unk> or slow down stop <unk> and then reverse so it starts to contract again <unk>  so a little over a decade ago <unk> two groups of physicists <unk> and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down <unk>  ok <unk> by how much less is it expanding today compared to say a couple of billion years ago <unk>  the startling answer to this question ok from these experiments was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago  ok so the expansion of space is actually speeding up this was a completely surprising result there is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen <unk>  ok <unk> no one was predicting ahead of time this is what 's going to be found it was the opposite of what was expected <unk>  so we need something to be able to explain that now it turns out in the mathematics you can put it in as a term that 's an energy but it 's a completely different type of energy from anything we 've ever seen before <unk> we call it dark energy <unk> and it has this effect of causing space to expand <unk> but we don 't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point ok so it 's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in  now <unk>  so at this point then what i want to really emphasize to you is that first of all dark matter and dark energy are completely different things ok there are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe and they have very different effects <unk> dark matter <unk> because it gravitationally attracts it tends to encourage the growth of structure ok so clusters of galaxies will tend to form because of all this gravitational attraction  dark energy on the other hand is putting more and more space between the galaxies makes it the gravitational attraction between them decrease and so it impedes the growth of structure so by looking at things like clusters of galaxies  and how they their number density how many there are as a function of time we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming  in terms of dark matter <unk> i said that we don 't have any you know really persuasive argument for dark energy do we have anything for dark matter and the answer is yes we have well motivated candidates for the dark matter <unk> now what do i mean by well well motivated <unk> i mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon ok things that i haven 't even talked about  that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting new particle so this is <unk> exactly what you want in physics where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory that was actually developed for something else <unk>  but we don 't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate  ok one or both <unk> who knows or it could be something completely different now we look for these dark matter particles because after all <unk> they are here <unk> in the room ok and they didn 't come in the door they just pass through anything they can come through the building through the earth they 're so non interacting  so one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it so a crystal that will ring if that happens so <unk> <unk> one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector <unk> and they 've put it deep down in an iron mine in minnesota <unk> deep under the ground and in fact in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far  they haven 't seen anything ok <unk> but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are  there 's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this <unk> the large hadron collider a particle physics accelerator that we 'll be turning on later this year it is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the large hadron collider <unk> of the big questions
