 <unk> people are more afraid of insects than they are of dying at least according to a one thousand nine hundred and seventy three book of lists survey which which preceded all those online best worst funniest lists that you see today <unk> only heights and public speaking exceeded the six legged as sources of fear <unk>  and i suspect if you had put spiders in there the combinations of insects and spiders would have just topped the chart <unk>  now i am not one of those <unk> really love insects i think they 're interesting and beautiful and sometimes even cute  and i 'm not alone for centuries some of the greatest minds in science from charles darwin to e o wilson  have drawn inspiration from studying some of the smallest minds on earth  well <unk> why is that what is that keeps us coming back to insects  some of it of course is just the sheer magnitude of almost everything about them they 're more numerous than any other kind of animal we don 't even know how many species of insects there are because new ones are being discovered all the time <unk>  there are at least a million <unk> maybe as many as ten million  this means that you could have an <unk> and not have to reuse a species for over eighty thousand years  take that pandas and kittens  more seriously  insects are essential we need them  it 's been estimated that one out of every three bites of food is made possible by a pollinator <unk>  scientist use insects to make fundamental discoveries about everything from the structure <unk> of our nervous systems to how our genes and dna work <unk>  but what i love most about insects is what they can tell us about our own behavior  insects seem like they do everything that people do they meet they mate they fight they break up  and they do so with what looks like love or <unk> but what drives their behaviors is really different than what drives our own and that difference can be really illuminating  there 's nowhere where that 's more true than when it comes to one of our most consuming interests sex <unk>  now i will maintain and i think i can defend what may seem like a surprising statement  i think sex in insects is more interesting <unk> and the wild variety that we see makes us challenge some of our own assumptions about what it means to be male and female of course to start with  a lot of insects don 't need to have sex at all to reproduce female aphids can make little tiny clones of themselves without ever mating <unk>  virgin birth right there on your rose bushes <unk> when they do have sex even their sperm is more interesting than human sperm there are some kinds of fruit flies whose sperm is longer than the male 's own body <unk> and that 's important because the males use their sperm to compete  now male insects do compete with weapons like the horns on these beetles <unk>  but they also compete after mating with their sperm <unk>  dragonflies and damselflies have penises that look kind of like swiss army knives with all of the attachments pulled out  they use these formidable devices like scoops to remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with  so what <unk> not a lesson in the sense of us imitating them or of them setting an example for us to follow which <unk>  given this is probably just as well and also did i mention sexual cannibalism is rampant among insects so no that 's not the point <unk> but what i think insects do is break a lot of the rules that we <unk> humans have about the sex roles  so people have this idea that nature dictates kind of a 1950s sitcom version of what males and females are like so that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive and females are passive and coy <unk> 's own body and <unk> they 're interesting <unk> a lot of insects <unk> supposed to be dominant and <unk> i really love
