 <unk> these are my words but this is not my voice <unk> this is alex the best computer voice i 've been able to find which comes as standard equipment on every macintosh <unk>  for most of my life i never gave a second thought to my ability to speak <unk> it was like breathing in those days <unk> i was living in a fool 's paradise <unk> after surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak <unk> eat or drink i was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me <unk>  for several days now we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at ted i used to be able to talk like that  <unk> maybe i wasn 't as smart <unk> but i was at least as talkative <unk>  i want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself <unk> and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one 's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away <unk>  however i 've found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous <unk> so i 've decided to recruit some of my ted friends to read my words aloud for me i will start with my wife chaz it was chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak <unk>  going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in two thousand and six  i expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show ' ebert and roeper at the movies i had pre taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation <unk>  the doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw  my tongue <unk> larynx and vocal cords were still <unk> i was optimistic and all was right with the world  the first surgery was a great success i saw myself in the mirror and i looked pretty good  two weeks later <unk> i was ready to return home <unk> home <unk> i was using my ipod to play the leonard cohen song ' i 'm your man ' for my doctors and nurses <unk>  suddenly i had an episode of catastrophic bleeding  my carotid artery had ruptured  thank god i was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there  chaz told me that if that song hadn 't played for so long i might have already been in the car on the way home <unk> and would have died right there and then  so thank you leonard cohen for saving my life  there was a second surgery which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart  <unk> then a third attempt <unk> which also patched me back together pretty well <unk> until it failed  a doctor from brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture <unk>  and before i left the hospital after a year of <unk> i had seven ruptures of my carotid artery  there was no particular day when anyone told me i would never speak again <unk> it just sort of became obvious  human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system <unk> we need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds  therefore <unk> the system must be essentially airtight in order to capture air <unk>  because i had lost my jaw <unk> i could no longer form a seal <unk> and therefore my tongue and all of my other vocal equipment <unk> i wrote messages in notebooks then i tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice <unk> this was faster and nobody had to try to read my handwriting <unk>  i tried out various computer voices that were available online and for several months i had a british accent <unk> which chaz called sir lawrence  it was the clearest i could find then apple released the alex voice which was the best i 'd heard it knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark when it saw a period it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air <unk>  there are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices and i 've experimented with them for me they share a fundamental problem they 're too <unk> when i find myself in a conversational situation <unk> i need to type fast and to jump right in people don 't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase <unk>  but what value do we place on the sound of our own voice <unk> how does that affect who you are as a person  when people hear alex speaking my words do they experience a disconnect does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next <unk>  how did i feel not being able to speak <unk> i felt <unk> and i still feel a lot of distance from the human mainstream  i 've become uncomfortable when i 'm separated from my laptop even then i 'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties  so chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my tv show voice from a period of thirty years <unk> at first i was against it i thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer <unk> there was something comforting about a voice that was not my own <unk>  but i decided then to just give it a try <unk> so we contacted a company in scotland that created personalized computer voices they 'd never made one from <unk> previously recorded materials all of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth <unk> but they were willing to give it a <unk> so i sent them many hours of recordings of my voice <unk> including several audio commentary tracks that i 'd made for movies on dvds <unk>  and it sounded like me it really did there was a reason for that it was me <unk>  but it wasn 't that simple <unk>  the tapes from my tv show weren 't very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved movie soundtracks for example or gene siskel arguing with me  and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn 't fit into a sentence <unk> well enough i 'll let you hear a sample of that voice <unk> these are a few of the comments i recorded for use when chaz and i appeared on the oprah winfrey program <unk>  and here 's the voice we call roger jr or roger two point zero roger two point zero  oprah <unk> i can 't tell you how great it is to be back on your show  we have been talking for a long time and now here we are again this is the <unk> first version of my computer voice <unk> it still needs improvement <unk> but at least it sounds like me and not like hal nine thousand <unk> when i heard it the first time it sent chills down my spine <unk>  when i type anything this voice will speak whatever i type when i read something  it will read in my voice i have typed these words in advance as i didn 't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing the voice was created by a company in scotland named cereproc <unk> it makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while i was commenting on casablanca  and citizen kane this is the first voice they 've created for an individual there are several very good voices available for <unk> computers <unk> but they all sound like somebody else <unk>  while this voice sounds like me i plan to use it on television radio and the internet  people who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built in speaking systems  many blind people use them to read pages on the web to themselves <unk>  but i 've got to say in first grade <unk> said i talked too much and now i still can roger ebert  as you can hear it sounds like me <unk> but the words jump up and down the flow isn 't natural <unk> the good people in scotland are still improving my voice <unk> and i 'm optimistic about it  but so far <unk> the apple alex voice is the best one i 've heard <unk> i wrote a blog about it and actually got <unk> a comment from the actor who played alex  he said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice a very large sample is needed john hunter  all my life i was a motormouth <unk> now i have spoken my last words and i don 't even remember for sure what they were  i feel like the hero of that harlan ellison story titled i have no <unk> mouth and i must scream on wednesday <unk> david christian explained to us what a tiny instant the human race represents in the time span of the universe for almost all of its millions and billions of years <unk> there was no life on earth at all  for almost all the years of life on earth there was no intelligent life only after we learned to pass knowledge from one generation to the next <unk> did civilization become possible in cosmological terms that was about ten minutes ago <unk>  finally came mankind 's most advanced and mysterious tool the computer  that has mostly happened in my lifetime  some of the famous early computers were being built in my hometown of urbana <unk> the birthplace of hal nine thousand <unk> i heard the amazing talk by salman khan on wednesday about the khan academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world <unk> i had a flashback <unk>  it was about one thousand nine hundred and sixty  as a local newspaper reporter still in high school i was sent over to the computer lab of the university of illinois to interview the creators of something called plato  the initials stood for <unk> programmed logic for automated teaching operations this was a computer assisted instruction system <unk>  which in those days ran on a computer named illiac <unk>  the programmers said it could assist students in their learning <unk> i doubt on that day fifty years ago <unk> they even dreamed of what salman khan has <unk> but that 's not the point  the point is plato was only fifty years ago an instant in time  it continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers <unk> until only five years ago <unk>  i have learned from wikipedia that starting with that humble beginning <unk> plato established forums <unk> message boards <unk> online <unk> since the first web browser was also developed in urbana <unk>  it appears that my hometown in downstate illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual online universe we occupy today <unk>  but i 'm not here from the chamber of <unk> i 'm here as a man who wants to communicate all of this has happened in my lifetime <unk> i started writing on a computer back in the <unk> when one of the first atech systems was installed at the chicago <unk> i was in line at radio shack to buy one of the first model one hundred 's and when i told the people in the press room at the academy awards <unk> they 'd better install some phone lines for internet connections <unk> they didn 't know what i was talking about  when i bought my first desktop it was a dec rainbow <unk> does anybody remember that  the sun times sent me to the cannes film festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the porteram telebubble <unk> i joined compuserve when it had fewer numbers than i currently have followers on twitter has happened in the blink of an eye <unk> it is unimaginable what will happen next <unk>  it makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history <unk>  indeed <unk> i am lucky to live in history at all because without intelligence and memory there is no history <unk> for billions of years the universe evolved completely without notice  now we live in the age of the internet which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness  and because of it <unk> i can communicate as well as i ever could  we are born into a box of time and space we use words and communication <unk> to break out of it and to reach out to others for me the internet began as a useful tool and now has become something i rely on for my actual daily existence <unk>  i cannot speak <unk> i can only type so fast computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated <unk> but with my computer <unk> i can communicate more widely than ever before  i feel as if my blog my email <unk> twitter and facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation  they aren 't an improvement <unk> but they 're the best i <unk> they give me a way to speak not everybody has the patience of my wife chaz <unk> but online everybody speaks at the same speed <unk>  this whole adventure has been a learning experience  every time there was a surgery that failed <unk> i was left with a little less flesh and bone now i have no jaw left at all <unk> harvesting tissue from both my shoulders the surgeries left me with back pain and reduced my ability to walk easily <unk>  ironic that my legs are fine <unk> and it 's my shoulders that slow up my walk  when you see me today <unk> i look like the phantom of the opera <unk> but no you don 't <unk> it is human nature to look at someone like me and assume i have lost some of my marbles people <unk> people talk loudly and slowly to me <unk> sometimes they assume i am deaf <unk> there are people who don 't want to make eye contact <unk> believe me he didn 't mean this as anyway let me just read it  you should never let your wife read something like this it is human nature to look <unk> don 't enjoy a reminder of our own fragile mortality that 's why writing on the internet has become a lifesaver for me  my ability to think and write have not been affected <unk> and on the web my real voice finds expression <unk>  i have also met many other disabled people who communicate this way  one of my twitter friends can type only with his toes one of the <unk> funniest blogs on the web is written by a friend of mine named smartass cripple  google him and he will make you laugh <unk> all of these people are saying in one way or another that what you see is not all you get  so i have not come here to complain <unk> i have much to make me happy and relieved i seem <unk> for the time being i am writing as well as ever i am productive  if i were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago <unk> i would be as isolated as a hermit <unk>  i would be trapped inside my head  because of the rush of human knowledge because of <unk> i have a voice <unk> and i do not need to scream re  wait <unk> i have one more thing to add  a guy goes into a psychiatrist <unk> the psychiatrist says you 're crazy the guy says i want a second opinion the psychiatrist says <unk> all right you 're ugly  you all know the test for artificial <unk> intelligence the turing test <unk> a human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer if the judge can 't tell the machine apart from the human the machine has passed the test <unk>  i now propose a test for computer voices the ebert test <unk> if a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as well as henny youngman then that 's the voice i want
