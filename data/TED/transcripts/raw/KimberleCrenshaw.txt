 <unk> like to try something new those of you who are able <unk> please stand up <unk> ok so i 'm going to name some names  when you hear a name that you don 't recognize you can 't tell me anything about them <unk> i 'd like you to take a seat and stay seated <unk> the last person standing we 're going to see what they know <unk> so those of you who are still standing i 'd like you to turn around and take a look i 'd say half to most of the people are still standing <unk> so let 's continue <unk> we look around again there are about four people still standing <unk> and actually i 'm not going to put you on the spot i just say that to encourage transparency so you can be seated <unk> of you who recognized the first group of names know that these were <unk> been killed by the police over the last two and a half years what you may not know is that the other list is also <unk> who have been killed within the <unk> only one thing distinguishes the names that you know from the names that you don 't know gender <unk>  so let me first let you know that there 's nothing at all distinct about this audience that explains the pattern of recognition that we 've just seen <unk>  i 've done this exercise dozens of times around the country <unk> i 've done it to women 's rights organizations <unk> i 've done it with civil rights groups <unk> i 've done it with professors <unk> i 've done it with students <unk> i 've done it with psychologists <unk> i 've done it with sociologists <unk>  i 've done it even with progressive members of congress and everywhere the awareness of the level of police violence that black women experience is exceedingly low <unk> would be the case i mean there are two issues involved here there 's police violence against <unk> and there 's violence against women two issues that have been talked about a lot lately <unk>  but when we think about who is implicated by these problems <unk> when we think about who is victimized by these problems  the names of these black women never come to mind now <unk> communications experts tell us that when facts do not fit with the available frames  people have a difficult time incorporating new facts into their way of thinking about a problem  these women 's names have slipped through our consciousness because there are no frames for us to see them <unk> no frames for us to remember them no frames for us to hold them <unk>  as a consequence reporters don 't lead with them <unk>  policymakers don 't think about them <unk> and politicians aren 't encouraged or demanded that they speak to them <unk>  now you might ask why does a frame matter black people and an issue that affects women wouldn 't that necessarily include black people who are women and women who are black people  well <unk> the simple answer is that this is a trickle down approach to social justice and many times it just doesn 't work <unk> without frames that allow us to see how social problems impact all the members <unk> of a targeted group many will fall through the cracks of our movements left to suffer in virtual isolation but it <unk> <unk> to be this way  many years ago i began to use the term intersectionality  to deal with the fact that many of our social justice problems like racism and <unk> sexism are often overlapping creating multiple levels of social injustice  now <unk> the experience that gave rise to intersectionality was my chance encounter with a woman named emma degraffenreid  <unk> a working wife and a mother <unk> i actually read about emma 's story from the pages of a legal opinion written by a judge who had dismissed emma 's claim of race and gender discrimination against a local car manufacturing plant emma like so many <unk> <unk> women sought better employment for her family and for others <unk> she wanted to create a better life for her children and for her family  but she applied for a job <unk> and she was not hired and she believed that she was not hired because she was a black woman  now <unk> the judge in question dismissed emma 's suit <unk>  and the argument for dismissing the suit was that the employer did hire <unk> employer hired women  the real problem though that the judge was not willing to acknowledge was what emma was actually trying to say that the <unk> <unk> that were hired <unk> usually for industrial jobs maintenance jobs were all men and the <unk> only if the court was able to see how these policies came together would he be able to see the double discrimination that emma degraffenreid was facing  but the court refused to allow emma to put two causes of action together to tell her story because he believed that by allowing her to do that <unk> she would be able to have preferential treatment she would have an advantage by having two swings at the bat  when <unk> african american men and white women only had one swing at the bat  but of <unk> <unk> men or white women needed to combine a race and gender discrimination claim to tell the <unk> story of the discrimination they were experiencing why wasn 't the real unfairness law 's refusal to protect <unk> women simply because their experiences weren 't exactly the same as white women and <unk> <unk> men rather than broadening the frame to include african american women the court simply tossed their case completely out of court  now as a student of antidiscrimination law as a feminist as an antiracist  i was struck by this case it felt to me like <unk> allowed to work at the plant <unk>  second of all the court doubled down on this exclusion by making it legally inconsequential and to boot  there was no name for this problem <unk>  and we all know that where there 's no name for a problem <unk> you can 't see a problem and when you can 't see a problem you pretty much can 't solve it <unk> many years later <unk> i had come to recognize that the problem that emma was facing was a framing problem <unk>  the frame that the court was using to see gender discrimination or to see race discrimination was partial <unk> and it was distorting  <unk> the challenge that i faced was trying to figure out whether there was an alternative narrative a prism that would allow us to see <unk> emma 's dilemma a prism that would allow us to rescue her from the cracks in the law that would allow judges to see her story  <unk> a simple analogy to an intersection might allow judges to better see emma 's dilemma <unk>  so if we think about this intersection the roads to the intersection would be the way that the workforce was structured by race and by gender  and then the traffic in those roads would be the hiring <unk> and the other practices that ran through those roads now because emma was both black and female she was positioned precisely where those roads overlapped  experiencing the simultaneous impact of the company 's gender and race traffic the law the law is like that ambulance that shows <unk> up and is ready to treat emma only if it can be shown that she was harmed on the race road or on the gender road but not where those roads intersected <unk>  so what do you call being impacted by multiple forces and then abandoned to fend for yourself intersectionality <unk> seemed to do it for me <unk> i would go on to learn that <unk> women like other women of color like other socially marginalized people all over the world were facing all kinds of dilemmas and challenges as a consequence of <unk> all of these social dynamics come together and create challenges that are sometimes quite unique <unk> but in the same way that intersectionality raised our awareness to the way that black women live their lives <unk> it also exposes the tragic circumstances under which <unk> <unk> women die police violence against black women is very real <unk> the level of violence that black women face is such that it 's not surprising that some of them do not survive their encounters with police black girls as young as seven <unk> great grandmothers as old as <unk> have been killed by the police <unk> they 've been killed in their living rooms  in their bedrooms <unk> they 've been killed in their cars <unk>  they 've been killed on the street <unk> they 've been killed in front of their parents <unk> been killed in front of their children <unk> they have been shot to death <unk>  they have been stomped to death <unk>  they have been suffocated to death <unk> they have been manhandled to death <unk> they have been tasered to death <unk>  they 've been killed when they 've called <unk> they 've been killed when they were alone and they 've been killed when they were with others <unk>  they 've been killed shopping while black <unk> driving while black <unk>  having a mental disability while black <unk> having a domestic disturbance while black <unk>  they 've even been killed being homeless while black <unk> they 've been killed <unk> talking on the cell phone <unk> laughing with friends <unk> sitting in a car reported as stolen and making a u turn in front of the white house with an infant strapped in the backseat of the car <unk>  why don 't we know these stories <unk>  <unk> is it that their lost lives don 't generate the same amount of media attention and communal outcry as the lost lives of their fallen brothers  it 's time for a change <unk>  so what can we do  in two thousand and fourteen the african american policy forum began to demand that we say her name at rallies at protests  at conferences <unk> at meetings  anywhere and everywhere that state violence against black bodies is being discussed <unk>  but saying her name is is not enough we have to be willing to do more we have to be willing to bear witness to bear <unk> witness to the often painful realities that we would just rather not confront <unk> the everyday violence and humiliation that many <unk> black women have had to face black women across color <unk> age gender expression sexuality and ability <unk>  bearing in mind that some of the images that i 'm about to share with you may be triggering for some to collectively bear witness to some of this violence we 're going to hear the voice of the phenomenal abby dobson <unk>  and as we sit with these women some who have experienced violence and <unk> who have not survived them <unk> we have an opportunity to reverse what happened at the beginning of this talk when we could not stand for these women because we did not know their names  so at the end of this clip there 's going to be a roll call  several black women 's names will come up <unk> like those of you who are able to join us in saying these names as loud as you can randomly <unk> disorderly  let 's create a cacophony of sound to represent our intention to hold these women up to sit <unk> to bear witness to them <unk> to bring them into the light <unk> so i said at the beginning if we can 't see a problem <unk> we can 't fix a problem <unk>  <unk> we 've come together to bear witness to these women 's lost lives <unk>  but the time now is to move from mourning and grief to action and transformation  this is something that we can do it 's up to us <unk>  thank you for joining us
