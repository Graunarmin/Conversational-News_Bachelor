 <unk> say about film making is about this film in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we 've heard here michael moschen and some of the talks about music  this idea that there is a narrative line <unk> and that music exists in time a film also exists in time it 's an experience <unk> you should go through emotionally <unk> and in making this film i felt that so many of the documentaries i 've seen were all about learning something or knowledge or driven by talking heads and driven by ideas <unk> and i wanted this film to be driven by emotions and really to follow my journey <unk>  so instead of doing the talking head thing instead it 's composed of scenes and we meet people along the way we only meet them once they don 't come back several <unk> times so it really chronicles a journey <unk> it 's something like life that once you get in it you can 't get out there are two clips i want to show you the first one is a kind of hodgepodge its just three little moments four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight <unk> it 's not the way they occur in the film because they are part of much <unk> they play off each other in a wonderful way <unk> and that ends with a little clip of my father of lou  talking about something that is very dear to him which is the accidents of life <unk> i think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental  and perhaps not planned at all  and those three clips will be followed by a scene of perhaps what to me is really his greatest building which is a building in dhaka bangladesh <unk> he built the <unk> and i think you 'll enjoy this building it 's never been seen it 's been still photographed but never photographed by a film crew we were the first film crew in there <unk>  so you 'll see images of this remarkable building  a couple of things to keep in mind when you see it <unk>  it was built entirely by hand i think they got a crane the last year <unk> it was built entirely by hand off bamboo <unk> people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads <unk> dumping them in the forms <unk> it is the capital of the country and it took <unk> twenty three years to build <unk>  which is something they seem seem to be very proud of over there it took as long as the taj mahal <unk> unfortunately it took so long that lou never saw it finished <unk>  he died in <unk> that when when you see that building that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished <unk>  and that really struck me about about my father in the sense that he had such belief that somehow  doing these things giving in the way that he gave that something good would come out of it even in the middle of a war there was a war with pakistan at one point and the construction stopped totally and he kept working  because he felt well when the war is done they 'll need this building so those are the two clips i 'm going to show roll that tape richard saul wurman  i remember hearing him talk at penn <unk> and i came home and i said to my father <unk> and he 's sort of ugly funny voice <unk>  and he 's a teacher at school i know you 've never heard of him <unk>  but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him <unk> because he 's really an amazing man <unk> when he was in rome moshe safdie he was a real nomad and you know when i knew him when i was in the office he would come in from a trip and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely and he would pack up and go  you know he 'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him i mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station <unk> it was so <unk> consistent with his life you know i mean i often think i 'm going to die in a plane or i 'm going to die in an airport or die jogging without an identification on me i don 't know why i sort of carry that from that memory of the way he died but he he was a sort of a nomad at heart <unk> our existences are really and how full of influence by circumstance <unk> on the <unk> morning workers who come all the time here and enjoy the walking city 's beauty and the atmosphere and this is the nicest place of bangladesh <unk> well actually i 'm here because i 'm the architect 's son <unk> never saw it finished <unk> like ours in thirty fifty years back <unk> it was nothing <unk> only paddy fields <unk>  and since we invited him here <unk> he felt that he has got a responsibility <unk>  he wanted to be a moses here <unk> he gave us democracy he is not a political man <unk> but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy <unk> from where we can <unk> he didn 't care for how much money this country has or whether he would be able to ever finish this building <unk> but somehow he has been able to do it build it here and this is the largest project he has got in here the poorest country in the world nk  it cost him his life sw  yeah <unk> he paid <unk> he paid his life for this and that is why he is great <unk> but he was also human <unk> now his failure to satisfy the family life is an inevitable association of great people but i think his son will understand this and will have no sense of grudge <unk> or sense of being neglected i think he cared in a very different manner but it takes a lot of time to understand that in social aspect of his life he was just like a child he was not at all matured <unk> he could not say no to anything <unk> and that is why that he cannot say no to things we got this building today  you see only that way you can be able to understand him  there is no other shortcut <unk> no other way to really understand him but i think he has given us this building <unk> we feel all the time for him that 's why he has given love for us he could not probably give the right kind of love for you but for us he has given the people the right kind of love that is important you have to understand that he had an enormous amount of love <unk> he loved everybody to love <unk> he sometimes did not see the very closest ones and that is inevitable for men of his stature
