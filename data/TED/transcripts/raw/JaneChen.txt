 <unk> please close your eyes <unk> and open your hands <unk>  now imagine what you could place in your hands an apple maybe your wallet <unk> now open your eyes <unk> what about a life  what you see here is a premature baby he looks like he 's resting peacefully <unk> but in fact he 's struggling to stay alive because he can 't regulate his own body temperature  this baby is so tiny he doesn 't have enough fat on his body to stay warm <unk>  sadly twenty million babies like this are born every year around the world  four million of these babies die annually <unk> but the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe long term health problems the reason is <unk> because in the first month of a baby 's life its only job is to grow  if it 's battling hypothermia its organs can 't develop normally <unk> resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes to heart disease to low i q  imagine many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm  that is the primary function of an incubator <unk> but traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to twenty thousand <unk> dollars so you 're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries  as a result parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies ' bodies <unk> or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here methods that are both ineffective and unsafe  i 've seen this firsthand over and over again on one of my first trips to india i met this young woman sevitha who had just given birth to a tiny premature <unk> baby <unk> rani she took her baby to the nearest village clinic and the doctor advised her to take rani to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator <unk> but that hospital was over four hours away and sevitha didn 't have the means to get there so her baby died  inspired by this story and dozens of other similar stories like this my team and i realized what was needed was a local solution <unk> that could work without electricity that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use given that the majority of births still take place in the home  we needed something that was portable something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something <unk> ultra low cost compared to the twenty thousand dollars that an incubator in the u s costs <unk>  so this is what we came up with what you see here looks nothing like an incubator it looks like a small sleeping bag for a <unk> baby you can open it up completely it 's waterproof there 's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily but the magic is in this pouch of wax  this is a phase change material it 's a wax like substance with a melting point of human body temperature <unk> thirty seven degrees celsius  you can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it 's able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time after which you simply reheat the pouch so you then place it into this little pocket back here and it creates a warm <unk> for the baby  looks simple but we 've reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors moms and clinicians to ensure that this <unk> really meets the needs of the local communities we plan to launch this product in india in two thousand and ten <unk> and the target price point will be twenty five dollars <unk> less than zero point one percent of the cost of a traditional incubator  over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies <unk> but the longer term social impact is a reduction in population growth  this seems counterintuitive but turns out that as infant <unk> mortality is reduced population sizes also decrease because parents don 't need to anticipate that their babies are going to die  we hope that the embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology simple localized affordable solutions that have the potential <unk> to make huge social impact
