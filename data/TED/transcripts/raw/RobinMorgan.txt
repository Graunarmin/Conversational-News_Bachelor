 <unk> when i was only three or four <unk> i fell in love with poetry  with the rhythms and the music of language with the power of metaphor and of imagery  poetry being the essence of communication the discipline the distillation and all these years later the poems i 'll read today are from my just finished seventh book of poetry well  five years ago i was diagnosed with parkinson 's disease  though there 's no cure yet <unk> advances in treatment are really impressive  but you can imagine that i was appalled to learn that women are largely left out of research trials <unk> despite <unk> gender specific medical findings having demonstrated that we are not actually just small men  who happen to have different reproductive systems gender specific medicine is good for men too but you bring to a crisis the person you already are  including the yes momentum that you 've learned to invoke through passionate <unk> caring and through action both of which require but also create energy <unk> so as an activist i began working with the parkinson 's disease foundation that to create a major initiative to put women on the parkinson 's disease <unk> and as a poet <unk> i began working with this subject matter <unk> finding it tragic <unk>  hilarious <unk> sometimes even joyful i do not feel diminished by parkinson 's i feel distilled by it and i actually very much like the woman i 'm distilling into  no signs of struggle growing small requires enormity of will just sitting still in <unk> the doctor 's waiting room watching the future shuffle in and out  watching it stoop stare at you while you try not to look <unk>  rare is an exchange a smile of brief wry recognition you are the new kid on the block <unk> everyone here was you once <unk> you are still learning that growing small requires a largeness of spirit you can 't fit into yet <unk>  acceptance of irritating help from those who love you  giving way and over but not up  you 've swallowed hard the contents of the drink me bottle and felt yourself shrink now familiar furniture looms <unk> floors <unk> and doorknobs yield only when wrestled round with both hands it demands colossal patience all this growing small  your diminished sleep at night your handwriting your voice your height  you are more the incredible shrinking woman than the buddhist mystic serene making do with less less is not always <unk> yet in this emptying space space glimmers  becoming visible here is a place behind the eyes of those accustomed by what some would call diminishment  it is a place of merciless poetry  a gift of presence previously ignored drowned in the daily clutter  here every gesture needs intention is alive with consciousness nothing is automatic  you can spot it in the provocation of a button  an arm poking at a sleeve a balancing act at a night time curb while negotiating the dark <unk>  feats of such modest valor who would suspect them to be exercises in an intimate <unk> a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware  such understated power here  in these tottering dancers who exert stupendous effort on tasks most view as insignificant  such quiet beauty here in these <unk> there is immensity required in growing small so bent on such unbending grace <unk> reassuring religious people already a universal donor <unk> kidneys corneas liver lungs tissue heart veins whatever  odd that the modest brain never imagined its unique value in research  maybe saving someone else from what it is they 're not quite sure i have  flattering that so fill in the forms <unk> drill through the answers <unk> out a blithe spirit and slice me <unk> dice me <unk> spread me on your slides <unk>  find what i 'm trying to tell you  earn me <unk> learn me <unk> scan me <unk>  squint through your lens <unk> uncover what i 'd hint at if i could  be my guest do your best harvest me <unk> track the clues this was a good brain while alive this was a brain that paid <unk> its dues so slice me <unk> dice me <unk> smear me on your slides <unk> stain me explain me <unk> drain me like a cup <unk>  share me <unk> hear me <unk> i want to be used i want to be used i want to be used up <unk> lit from within is the sole secure way to traverse dark matter <unk>  some life forms certain mushrooms <unk> snails jellyfish worms glow bioluminescent <unk> and <unk> light from our most lucent selves our tragedy is we can 't see it we see by reflecting to show our true colors  external illumination can distort though when gravity bends light <unk> huge galaxy clusters can act as <unk> background images of star systems to faint arcs a lensing effect like viewing distant street lamps through a glass of wine  a glass of wine or two now makes me weave as if acting the drunkard 's part as if besotted with unrequited love for the dynamic turner canvasses spied out by the <unk> i could lurch down a city street set without provoking every pedestrian walk on stare  stare as long as you need to if you think about it <unk> walking even standing is illogical such tiny things feet  especially when one 's body is not al dente anymore <unk> and excess i 've always thought apollo beautiful but boring and a bit of a dumb blonde dionysians don 't do balance  balance in other words <unk> has never been my strong point  but i digress more and more these days digression seems the most direct route through from where i 've lost or found myself out of place mind turn <unk> time  place your foot just so mind how you turn too swift a swivel can bring you down  take your time ushering the audience out saying goodbye to the actors  the ghost light is what they call the single bulb hanging above the bare stage in an empty theater  in the empty theater of such a night <unk> waking to meet no external radiance  this is the final struggle left to win this the sole beacon to beckon the darkness in and let the rest begin  this the lens through which at last to see both self and other arrayed with the bright stain of original sin lit from within is the last one  this dark hour  late summer four a m  the rain slows to a stop <unk> dripping still from the broad leaves of blue hostas unseen in the garden 's barefoot <unk> careful on the slick slate slabs i need no light i know the way  stoop by the mint bed scoop a fistful of moist earth <unk>  then grope for a chair <unk> spread a shawl and sit <unk> breathing in the wet green <unk> this is the small still hour before the newspaper lands in the vestibule like a grenade the phone <unk> shrills the computer screen blinks and glares awake  there is this hour <unk> poem in my head soil in my hand unnamable fullness  this hour when blood of my blood bone of bone child grown to manhood now stranger <unk> intimate <unk> not distant but apart lies safe off dreaming melodies while love sleeps <unk> safe <unk> in his arms  to have come to this place <unk> lived to this moment <unk> immeasurable lightness  the density of black starts to blur <unk> tentative a cardinal 's coloratura <unk> then the mourning dove 's elegy <unk>  sable glimmers toward grey <unk> objects emerge trailing shadows night ages toward day  the city stirs <unk>  there will be other dawns <unk> nights <unk> gaudy noons <unk> <unk> lose my way there will be stumbling falling cursing the dark <unk> whatever comes <unk> there was this hour when nothing mattered all was unbearably dear <unk>  and when i 'm done with daylights <unk> should those who loved me grieve too long a while let them remember that i had this hour this dark and smile
