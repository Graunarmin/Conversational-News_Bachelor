 <unk> i would start with a simple request i 'd like all of you to to pause for a moment you wretched weaklings and take stock of your <unk> that was the advice that st benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century it was the advice that i decided to follow myself when i turned forty  up until that moment <unk> i had been that classic corporate warrior i was eating too much i was drinking too much i was working too hard and i was neglecting the family <unk>  and i decided that i would try and turn my life around in particular i decided i would try to address the thorny issue of work life balance <unk>  so i stepped back from the workforce <unk>  and i spent a year at home with my wife and four young children <unk>  but all i learned about work life balance from that year was that i found it quite easy to balance work and life when i didn 't have any work not a very useful skill especially when the when the money runs out so i went back to work and i 've spent these seven years since struggling with studying and writing about work life <unk> i have four observations i 'd like to share with you today the first is if society 's to make any progress on this issue we need an honest debate <unk> but the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work life balance  all the discussions about <unk> which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day to day basis with a young family <unk>  now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you 're <unk> and the reality of the society that we 're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet screaming desperation <unk> where they work long hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don 't need to impress people they don 't like it 's my contention that going to work on friday in jeans and [ a ] t shirt isn 't really getting <unk> to the nub of the issue  the second observation i 'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren 't going to solve this issue for us we should stop looking outside <unk> it 's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead <unk> you don 't design your life someone else will design it for you and you may just not like their idea of balance <unk>  it 's particularly important this isn 't on the world wide web is it i 'm about to get fired it 's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial <unk> i 'm not talking here just about the bad companies the abattoirs of the human soul as i call them i 'm talking about all companies <unk> because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you [ as ] they can get away with it 's in their nature it 's in their dna it 's what they do <unk> on the one hand <unk> putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened  on the other hand it 's a nightmare it just means you spend more time at the bloody office  we have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life the third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance <unk>  before i went back to work after my year at home <unk> i sat down and i wrote out a detailed description of the ideal balanced day that i aspired <unk> and it went like this wake up well rested after a good night 's sleep  have sex <unk> walk the dog <unk> have breakfast with my wife and children <unk>  have sex again  laughter drive the kids to school on the way to the office do three <unk> play a sport with a friend at lunchtime  do another three hours ' work <unk> meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink <unk>  drive home for dinner with my wife and kids <unk> meditate for half an hour  have sex <unk>  walk the dog <unk> have sex again <unk> how often do you think i have that day  we need to be realistic  you can 't do it all in one day we need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the i 'll have a life when i retire when my kids have left home <unk> wife has divorced me my health is failing <unk> i 've got no mates or interests left  a day is too short after i retire is too long there 's got to be a middle way  a fourth observation we need to approach balance in a balanced way  <unk> a friend came to see me last year and she doesn 't mind me telling this story a friend came to see me last year and said nigel i 've read your book <unk> and i realize that my life is completely out of balance <unk> it 's totally dominated by work <unk>  i work ten hours a day <unk> i commute two hours a day all of my relationships have failed <unk> there 's nothing in my life apart from my work <unk>  so i 've decided to get a grip and sort it out <unk> i don 't mean to mock <unk> but being a fit 10 hour a day office rat isn 't more balanced <unk> it 's more fit  lovely though physical exercise may be there are other parts to life there 's the intellectual side there 's the emotional side there 's the <unk> i believe we have to attend to all of those areas not just do fifty stomach crunches <unk>  now that can be daunting <unk> because people say bloody hell mate <unk> i haven 't got time to get fit <unk> you want me to go to church and call my mother  and i understand i truly understand how that can be daunting <unk> but an incident that happened a couple of years <unk> gave me a new perspective my wife who is somewhere in the audience today <unk> called me up at the office and said nigel you need to pick our youngest son harry up from school because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening  so i left work an hour early that afternoon and picked harry up at the school gates we walked down to the local park <unk> messed around on the swings played some silly games <unk> i then walked him up the hill to the local cafe <unk> and we shared a pizza for two  then walked down the hill to our home and i gave him his bath and put him in his batman pajamas <unk> i then read him a chapter of roald dahl 's james and the giant peach  i then put him to bed <unk> tucked him in gave him a kiss on his forehead and said goodnight mate  <unk> this has been the best day of my life <unk> ever  i hadn 't done anything  hadn 't taken him to disney world or bought him a playstation <unk> now my point is the small things matter  being more balanced doesn 't mean dramatic upheaval in your <unk> life with the smallest investment in the right places <unk> you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life <unk>  moreover <unk> i think <unk> it can transform society <unk>  because if enough people do it we can change society 's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins <unk> wins to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like  and that i think is an idea worth spreading
