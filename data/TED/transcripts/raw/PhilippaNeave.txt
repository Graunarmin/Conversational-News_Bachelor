 <unk> the great philosopher aristotle said if something doesn 't exist <unk> there 's no word for it and if there 's no word for something that something doesn 't <unk> so when we talk about elections we in established democracies we know what we 're talking about we 've got the words we have the vocabulary we know what a polling station is we know what a ballot paper is  but what about countries where democracy doesn 't exist  countries where there are no words to describe the concepts that underpin a democratic <unk> i work in the field of electoral assistance so that 's to say we assist emerging democracies to organize what is often their first elections  when people ask me what i do quite often i get this answer oh <unk> so you 're one of these people who goes around the world imposing western democracy on countries that can 't handle it  <unk> the united nations does not impose anything on anybody <unk>  it really doesn 't and also what we do is firmly anchored in the one thousand nine hundred and forty eight universal declaration of human rights article twenty one that says that everybody should have the right to choose who governs them <unk>  so that 's the basis of the work i specialize in public outreach what does that mean another jargon it actually means designing <unk> information campaigns so that candidates and voters who have never had the opportunity to participate or to vote understand where when how to register where when how to vote <unk> why <unk> why it is important to take part so i 'll probably devise a specific campaign to reach out to women to make sure that they can take part that they can be part of the process <unk> young people as well all sorts of people <unk> handicapped people we try to reach everybody <unk>  and it 's not always easy because very often in this work i 've noticed now over the years that i 've been doing it that words are lacking <unk> and so what do you do afghanistan <unk> it 's a country with high levels of illiteracy the thing about that was it was in two thousand and five <unk> and we organized two elections on the same day the reason was because the logistics are so incredibly difficult  it seemed to be more efficient to do that it was  but on the other hand explaining two elections instead of one was even more complicated so we used a lot of images and when it <unk> came to the actual ballot <unk> we had problems because so many people wanted to take part we had three hundred candidates for for fifty two seats in the <unk> wolesi jirga which is the parliamentary elections  and for the provincial council we had even more candidates we had three hundred and thirty for fifty four seats so talking about ballot design <unk> is what the ballot looked like it 's the size of a newspaper this was the wolesi jirga ballot yeah and this was the provincial council ballot even more so you see we did use a lot of symbols and things like <unk> we had other problems in southern sudan southern sudan was a very different story <unk> we had so many people who had never of course voted but we had extremely extremely high levels of illiteracy  very very poor infrastructure for example i mean it 's a country the size of texas more or less we had seven kilometers of paved <unk> seven kilometers in the whole country <unk> and that includes the tarmac where we landed the planes in juba airport so transporting electoral materials etc is exceedingly difficult  people had no idea about what a box looked like <unk> it was very complicated <unk>  so using verbal communication was obviously the way to go <unk> but there were one hundred and <unk> that was extremely challenging then i arrived in tunisia in two thousand and eleven <unk> it was the arab spring a huge amount of of hope was generated by that enormous movement that was going on in the region there was libya there was egypt there was yemen <unk>  it was an enormous enormous historical moment and i was sitting with the election commission <unk> and we were talking about various aspects of <unk> of the of the election and i was hearing them using words that i hadn 't actually heard before and i 'd worked with iraqis i 'd worked with jordanians egyptians and suddenly they were using these words and i just thought this is strange and what really gave rise to it was this word observer we were discussing election observers <unk> and <unk> in a passive sort of sense as in i noticed he was wearing a light blue shirt did i go and check whether the shirt was light blue or not  that is the role of an election observer <unk> it 's very active it 's governed by all kinds of treaties and it has got that control function in it and then i got wind of the fact <unk> followers of an election so that 's not quite right either <unk> because there is a term that 's already accepted and in use which was the word muraqib which means a controller it 's got that notion of control so i thought three words for one concept this is not good <unk>  and with our colleagues we thought perhaps it 's our role to actually help make sure that the words are understood and actually <unk> create a work of reference that could be used across the arab region <unk>  and that 's what we did so together with these colleagues we launched the arabic lexicon of electoral terminology  and we worked in eight different countries it meant actually defining four hundred and eighty one terms which formed the basis of everything you need to know if you 're going to organize a democratic election <unk> we defined these terms and we worked with the arab colleagues and came to an agreement about what would be the appropriate word to use in arabic <unk>  because the arabic language is very rich <unk> and that 's part of the problem but there are twenty two countries that speak arabic <unk> and they use modern standard <unk> which is the arabic that is used across the whole region in newspapers and broadcasts  but of course then from one country to the next in day to day language and use it varies dialect colloquialisms etc <unk> so that was another added layer of complication so in one sense you had the problem that language wasn 't fully ripe if you like neologisms were coming up new expressions and so we defined all these terms and then we had eight correspondents in <unk> in the in the region <unk> we submitted the draft to them  they responded back to us yes we understand the definition we agree with it but this is what we say in our country because we were not <unk> <unk> going to harmonize or force harmonization we were trying to facilitate understanding among people <unk>  <unk> the various countries  so this i 'm happy to say it took three years to produce this because we also finalized the draft and took it actually into the field sat with the election <unk> <unk> commissions in all these different countries debated and defined and refined the draft  <unk> date there 's about three thousand downloads off the internet in pdf form  i heard just recently from a colleague that they 've taken it up in somalia they 're going to produce a version of this in somalia because there 's nothing in somalia at all so that 's that 's very good to know <unk> and this newly formed arab <unk> are run in the region they 're using it as well and the arab league have now built up a pan arab observation unit and they 're using it so that 's all really good <unk> however this work of reference is is quite high pitched it 's complex and a lot of the terms are quite technical so the average person probably doesn 't need to know at least a third of it <unk> but the people of the middle east have been deprived of any form of what we know as civic education it 's part of our curriculum at school it doesn 't really exist in in that part of the world <unk>  and i feel it 's really the right of everybody to know how these things work and it 's a good thing to think about producing a work of reference for the average person and bearing in mind that now we have a basis to work with  but also we have technology so we can reach out using telephone apps <unk> video <unk> animation there 's all sorts of tools <unk> <unk> that can be used now to communicate these ideas to people for the first time in their own language <unk>  <unk> terrorism we hear about sectarianism and all this horrible negative news that comes to us all the time what we 're not hearing is what are the people the everyday people thinking what are they aspiring to <unk>  let 's give them the means let 's give them the words  the silent majority is silent because they don 't have the words the silent <unk> majority needs to know it is time to provide people with the knowledge tools that they can inform themselves with  the silent majority does not need to be silent let 's help them have a voice <unk> thank you very much
