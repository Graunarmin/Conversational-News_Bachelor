 <unk> when i do my job people hate me in fact the better i do my job the more people hate me  and no i 'm not a meter maid <unk> and i 'm not an undertaker <unk> i am a progressive lesbian talking head on fox news so y 'all heard that right just to make sure right i am a gay talking head on fox news i am going to tell you how i do it  and the most important thing i 've learned <unk>  so i go on television i debate people who literally want to obliterate everything i believe in in some cases who don 't want me and people like me to even exist  it 's sort of like thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids with a live television audience of millions it 's totally almost just like that <unk> and that 's just on air the hate mail i get is unbelievable last week alone i got two hundred and thirty eight pieces of nasty email and more hate tweets than i can even count <unk> i was called an idiot a traitor a scourge a cunt and an ugly man and <unk> was just in one email  so what have i realized being on the receiving end of all this ugliness <unk> well my biggest takeaway is that for decades we 've been focused on political correctness <unk> but what matters more is emotional correctness let me give you a small example <unk> i don 't care if you call me a dyke i really don 't <unk> i care <unk> about two things one i care that you spell it right  applause just quick refresher it 's <unk> you 'd totally be surprised <unk>  and second i don 't care about the word i care about how you use it are you being friendly are you just being naive or do you really want to hurt me personally <unk> emotional correctness is the tone the feeling how we say what we say the respect and compassion we show one another <unk>  and what i 've realized is that political persuasion doesn 't begin with ideas or facts or data  political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct <unk>  so when i first went to go work at fox news true confession i <unk> expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle dragging  that by the way in case you 're paying attention is not emotionally correct <unk> but liberals on my side <unk>  we can be self righteous we can be condescending we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn 't agree with us in other words we can be politically <unk> that means that people don 't like us <unk> right <unk> now here 's the kicker <unk>  conservatives are really nice  i mean not all of them and not the ones who send me hate mail but you would be surprised <unk> sean hannity is one of the sweetest guys i 've ever met  he spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates <unk> and i know that if i ever had a problem he would do anything he could to help <unk>  now  i think sean hannity is <unk> ninety nine percent politically wrong <unk> but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive <unk> and that 's why people listen to him  because you can 't get anyone to agree with you if they don 't even listen to you first we spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements <unk> and if we can start to find compassion for one another <unk> then we have a shot at building common ground  it actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here <unk> but when you try to put it in practice it 's really powerful so someone who says they hate immigrants i try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they 've always known or someone who says <unk> they don 't like teachers ' unions i bet they 're really devastated to see their kid 's school going into the gutter and they 're just looking for someone to blame  our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us that is emotional correctness i 'm not saying it 's easy <unk> an average of like five point six times per day i have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities <unk> this whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a <unk> practice for me and i ain 't the dalai lama i 'm not perfect <unk> but what i am <unk> because i don 't just get hate mail  i get a lot of really nice letters <unk> lots of them and one of my all time favorites begins i am not a big fan of your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic  laughter but i 'm a big fan of you as a person now this guy doesn 't agree with me yet <unk> he 's listening not because of what i said but because of how i said it and somehow even though we 've never met we 've managed to form a connection  that 's emotional correctness <unk> and that 's how we start the conversations that really lead to change <unk> thank you
