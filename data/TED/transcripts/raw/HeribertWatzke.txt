 <unk> a very important impact on us it changed the way our history developed <unk> but it 's a technology so pervasive so invisible <unk> to take it into account when we talked about human evolution <unk> but we see the results of this technology still so let 's make a little test <unk>  so everyone of you turns to their neighbor please <unk> turn and face your neighbors <unk> please also on the balcony do you see any canine teeth  laughter count dracula teeth in the mouths of your neighbors of course not because our dental anatomy is actually made not for tearing down raw meat from bones or chewing fibrous leaves for hours is made for a diet which is soft <unk> mushy <unk>  which is reduced in fibers <unk> which is very easily chewable and digestible <unk>  sounds like fast food food transformation made us what we are  so i would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves <unk> we talk about ourselves as omnivores i would say we should call ourselves coctivors <unk> to live of cooked food <unk> so cooking is a very important technology it 's technology i don 't know how you feel but i like to cook for entertainment  and you need some design to be successful <unk> so cooking is a very important technology because it allowed us to acquire what brought you all here <unk> the big brain <unk>  this wonderful cerebral cortex we have because brains are expensive <unk> those have to pay tuition fees know  but it 's also metabolically speaking expensive <unk>  you now our brain is two to three percent of the body mass but actually it uses twenty five percent of the total energy we use it 's very <unk> where does the energy come from of course from food <unk> if we eat raw food we cannot release really the energy <unk>  so this ingenuity of our ancestors to invent this most marvelous technology <unk> invisible everyone of us does it every day so to speak cooking made it possible that mutations <unk> natural selections our environment could develop us <unk> so if we think about this unleashing human potential which was possible by cooking and food <unk> why do we talk so badly about food <unk> why is it always do and don 'ts and it 's good for you it 's not good for you  i think the good news for me would be if we could go back and talk about the unleashing the continuation of the unleashing of human potential now cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species <unk> we walked out of africa two times  we populated all the ecologies if you can cook <unk> nothing can happen to you  because whatever you find you will try to transform it it keeps also your brain working easy and simple technology which was developed actually runs after this formula take something which looks like food <unk>  transform it and it gives you a good very easy accessible energy this technology affected two organs  the brain and the gut <unk> which it actually affected the brain could grow <unk> but the gut actually shrunk okay it 's not obvious to be honest it shrunk to sixty percent of primate gut of my body mass <unk> so because of having cooked food it 's easier to digest  now having a large brain <unk> as you know  is a big advantage because you can actually influence your environment you can influence your own technologies you have invented you can continue <unk> to innovate and invent <unk> now the big brain did this also with cooking <unk> but how did it actually run this show how did it actually interfere what kind of criteria did it use and this is actually taste reward and energy <unk> you know we have up to five tastes three of them sustain us <unk> <unk> this is a meaty taste you need proteins for muscles <unk> recovery <unk>  salty <unk> because you need salt <unk> otherwise your electric body will not work and two tastes which protect you bitter and sour <unk> which are against poisonous and rotten material <unk>  <unk> but we use them still in a sophisticated way think about bittersweet chocolate or think about the acidity of yogurt wonderful mixed with strawberry fruits so we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know that in cooking we can transform it to the form reward this is a more complex and especially integrative form of our brain with various different elements the external states our internal states how do we feel and so on are put together <unk> and something which maybe you don 't like but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat so satisfaction was a very important part and as i say energy was necessary <unk>  now how did the gut actually participate in this development and the gut is a silent <unk> voice it 's going more for feelings i use the euphemism digestive comfort actually it 's a digestive discomfort which the gut is concerned with  if you get a stomach ache if you get a little bit bloated was not the right food <unk> was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong <unk>  so my story is a tale of two brains because it might <unk> surprise you our gut has a full fledged brain <unk>  all the managers in the room say you don 't tell me something new because we know gut feeling this is what we are using  laughter and actually you use it and it 's actually useful because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system <unk> they do speak with each other and make decisions <unk> what it means to have a brain there is that not only the big brain has to talk with the the food the food has to talk with the brain <unk> because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains <unk> now if there 's a gut brain we should also learn to talk with this brain now one hundred fifty years ago anatomists described very very carefully here is a model of a wall of a gut <unk> i took the three elements stomach small intestine and colon <unk>  and within this structure you see these two pinkish layers which are actually the muscle <unk> and between this muscle they found nervous tissues a lot of nervous tissues <unk> which penetrate actually the muscle penetrate the <unk> where you have all the elements for the immune system the gut is actually the largest immune system <unk> defending your body it penetrates the mucosa this is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest <unk> which is actually the lumen <unk> now if you think about the gut the gut is if you could stretch it forty meters long the length of a tennis court if we could unroll it get out all the folds and so on it would have four hundred <unk> meters of surface and now this brain takes care over this to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and of course digest our food we cook <unk>  so if we give you a specification this brain which is autonomous have five hundred million nerve cells one hundred million neurons so around the size of a cat brain so there sleeps a little cat thinks for itself <unk> optimizes whatever it digests it has twenty different neuron types it 's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain where you have one hundred billion neurons  it has autonomous organized microcircuits has these programs which run <unk> it senses the food it knows exactly what to do  it senses it by chemical means <unk> very importantly by mechanical means  because it has to move the food it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion <unk>  this control of muscle is very very important because you know there can be reflexes if you don 't like a food especially if you 're a child <unk> you gag <unk> it 's this brain which makes this reflex <unk>  and then finally <unk> it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery which actually digests the <unk> we cook <unk> now how do the two brains work with each other i took here a model from robotics it 's called the subsumption architecture what it means is that we have a layered control system  the lower layer our gut brain has its own goals digestion defense and we have the higher brain <unk> of integration and generating behaviors <unk>  now both look and this is the blue arrows both look to the same food which is in the lumen and in the area of your intestine <unk>  the big brain integrates signals which come from the running programs of the lower brain <unk>  but subsumption means that the higher brain can interfere with the lower it can replace or it can <unk> so if we take two types of signals a hunger signal for example  if you have an empty stomach your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin it 's a very big signal <unk>  it 's sent to the brain says go and eat  you have stop signals we have up to eight stop signals at least in my case <unk> they are not listened to  so what happens if the big brain integration overrides the signal <unk> so if you override the hunger signal <unk> you can have a disorder which is called anorexia <unk>  despite generating a healthy hunger signal the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut the more usual case <unk> it actually takes the signal and changes it and we continue even [ though ] our eight signals would say stop enough we have transferred enough energy  now the interesting thing is that along this lower layer layer this gut the signal becomes stronger and stronger if undigested but digestible <unk> could penetrate this we found from bariatric surgery that then the the signal would be very very high <unk> so now back to the cooking question and back to the design we have learned to talk to the big brain taste and reward as you know <unk> now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain that its signals are so strong that the big brain cannot ignore it then we would generate something all of us would like to have a balance between the hunger and the satiation now i give you from our research a very short claim <unk> this is fat digestion you have on your left an olive oil droplet and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes this is an in vitro experiment <unk> everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens when the constituents are liberated <unk> they disappear <unk> they go away because they [ were ] absorbed  actually what happens is that a very intricate structure appears and i hope you can see that there are some ring like structures in the middle image <unk>  which is water this whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes to attack the remaining oil <unk> and finally on your right side you see a bubbly cell like structure appearing from which the body will absorb the fat <unk>  now if we could take this language and this is a language of structures and make it <unk> that it can go through the <unk> so our research and i think the research also at the universities are now fixing on these points to say <unk> how can we actually and this might sound trivial now to you how can we change cooking how can we cook that we have this language developed <unk> so what we have actually it 's not an omnivore 's dilemma we have a coctivor 's opportunity because we have learned over the last two million years which taste and reward quite sophisticated to cook to please ourselves to satisfy ourselves if we add the matrix if we add the structure language which we have to learn  when we learn it then we can put it back and around energy we could generate a balance which comes out from our really primordial operation cooking <unk> so to make cooking really a very important element i would say even philosophers have to change and have to finally recognize that cooking is what made us <unk> so i would say <unk> coquo ergo sum i cook therefore i am <unk> thank you very much
