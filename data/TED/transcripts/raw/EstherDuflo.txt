 <unk> going to be clear in a moment <unk> maybe a sobering thought <unk> and i suspect many of you gave something to the people of haiti this year and there is something else i believe in the back of your mind you also know that is every day twenty five thousand children die of entirely preventable causes <unk>  that 's a haiti earthquake every eight days <unk>  and i suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well <unk> but somehow it doesn 't happen with the same <unk> intensity <unk> so why is that <unk>  well here is a thought experiment for you  imagine you have a few million dollars that you 've raised maybe you 're a politician in a developing country and you have a budget to spend you want to spend it on the poor <unk>  how do you go about it <unk>  do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money that we know how to eradicate poverty we just need <unk> to do more or do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help  on the contrary it might hurt it might exacerbate corruption <unk> dependence etc or maybe you turn to the past after all we have spent billions of dollars on aid <unk> maybe you look at the past and see has it done any good  and sadly we don 't know <unk> and worst of all we will never know the reason is that take africa for example africans have already got a lot of aid these are the blue bars <unk>  and the gdp in africa is not making much progress  okay fine <unk> how do you know what would have happened without the aid <unk> maybe it would have been much worse <unk>  or maybe it would have been better we have no idea <unk> we don 't know what the counterfactual is there 's only one africa <unk> so what do you do to give the aid and hope and pray that something comes out of it <unk> or do you focus on your everyday life and let the earthquake every eight days continue to happen <unk> the thing is <unk> if we don 't know whether we are doing any good  we are not any better than the medieval doctors and their leeches <unk>  sometimes the patient gets better <unk> sometimes the patient <unk> leeches is it something else <unk> we don 't know <unk>  so here are some other questions they 're smaller questions <unk> but they are not that small  immunization <unk> that 's the cheapest way to save a child 's life  and the world has spent a lot of money on it the gavi and the gates foundations are each pledging a lot of money towards it and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort <unk>  and yet every year at least twenty five million children do not get the immunization they should get  so this is what you call a last mile problem  the technology is there <unk>  the infrastructure is there and yet it doesn 't happen <unk> so you have your million how do you use your million to solve this last mile problem <unk>  and here 's another question <unk> kills almost nine hundred thousand people every year <unk>  most of them in sub saharan africa <unk> most of them under five in fact that is the leading cause of under five mortality <unk>  we already know how to kill malaria <unk> but some people come to you and say you have your millions how about bed nets  bed nets are very <unk> ten dollars you can manufacture and ship an insecticide treated bed net and you can teach someone to use them  and not only do they protect the people who sleep under them but they have these great contagion benefits  if half of a community sleeps under a net <unk> the other half also benefits because the contagion of the disease spread <unk>  and yet only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net <unk> societies should be willing to go out and subsidize the net give them for free or for that matter pay people to use <unk> them because of those contagion benefits  not so fast say other people if you give the nets for free people are not going to value them <unk>  they 're not going to use them or at least they 're not going to use them as bed nets <unk> maybe as fishing nets  so what do you do do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them <unk> how do you know <unk>  and a third question education maybe that 's the solution maybe we should send kids to school but how do you do that  do you hire teachers <unk> do you build more schools do you provide school lunch <unk> how do you know <unk>  so here is the thing <unk> i cannot answer the big question <unk> whether aid did any good or not but these three questions <unk> i can answer them <unk>  <unk> and in the 20th century randomized controlled trials have revolutionized medicine by allowing us to distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that don 't work  and you can do the same randomized controlled trial for social policy <unk>  you can put social innovation to the same rigorous <unk> scientific tests that we use for drugs and in this way <unk> you can take the <unk> guesswork out of <unk> by knowing what works what doesn 't work and why  and i 'll give you some examples with those three questions <unk>  so i start with immunization here 's udaipur district rajasthan <unk> beautiful <unk>  well when i started working there about one percent of children were fully immunized <unk> that 's bad <unk> but there are places like that <unk> now it 's not because the vaccines are not there they are there and they are free and it 's not because parents do not care about their kids the same child that is not immunized against measles <unk> if they do get measles parents will spend thousands of rupees to help them <unk>  so you get these empty village <unk> subcenters and crowded hospitals so what is the problem <unk> part of the problem surely is people do not fully understand <unk> after all in this country as well <unk> all sorts of myths and misconceptions go around immunization <unk>  so if that 's the case that 's difficult <unk> because persuasion is really difficult <unk>  but maybe there is another problem as well <unk> it 's going from intention to action <unk>  imagine you are a mother in udaipur district <unk> rajasthan you have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized <unk> and maybe when you get there what you find is this the subcenter is closed <unk> you have to come back and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do you will always tend to postpone and postpone and eventually it gets too late well  if that 's the problem <unk> then that 's much easier because a we can make it easy  and b we can maybe give people a reason to act today rather than wait till tomorrow  <unk> so these are simple ideas but we didn 't know so let 's try them <unk>  so what we did is we did a randomized controlled trial in one hundred and thirty four villages in udaipur districts  so the blue dots are selected randomly we made it easy i 'll tell you how in a moment in the red dots <unk> we made it easy and gave people a reason to act now <unk>  the white dots are comparisons <unk> nothing changed <unk>  so we make it easy by organizing this monthly camp where people can get their kids immunized <unk> and then you <unk> make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization  now a kilo of lentils is tiny <unk> it 's never going to convince anybody to do something that they don 't want to do  on the other hand if your problem is you tend to postpone <unk> then it might give you a reason to act today rather than later <unk>  <unk> everything is the same that 's the beauty of randomization the camp just having the camp increases immunization from six percent to seventeen percent that 's full immunization <unk> that 's not bad <unk> that 's a good improvement  add the lentils and you reach to thirty eight percent so here you 've got your answer  make it easy and give a kilo of lentils you multiply immunization rate <unk> but it 's not sustainable we cannot keep giving lentils to people well it turns out it 's wrong economics because it is cheaper to give lentils than not to give them <unk> since you have to pay for the nurse anyway <unk>  the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don 't  how about bed nets <unk> should you give them for free or should you ask people to pay for them <unk>  so the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions one is <unk> must pay for a bed net are they going to purchase them <unk> the second one is if i give bed nets for free are people going to use them <unk>  and the third one is do free bed nets discourage future purchase the third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts <unk> it might destroy markets to distribute free bed <unk> now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric <unk>  it 's more ideological than practical <unk> but it turns out it 's an easy question we can know the answer to this question we can just run an experiment <unk>  and many experiments have been run and they all have the same results so i 'm just going to talk to you about one  and this one that was in kenya they went around and distributed to people vouchers discount vouchers <unk> so people with their voucher could get the bed net in the local pharmacy <unk>  and some people get one hundred percent discount and some people get twenty percent discounts and some people get fifty percent discount etc  and now we can see what happens  so how about the purchasing <unk>  well what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets <unk> the coverage rate really falls down a lot so even with partial subsidy three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net and now you only have twenty percent of the people with <unk> bed nets <unk> you lose the health immunity that 's not great <unk>  second thing is how about the use  well the good news is people if they have the bed nets <unk> will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it if they get it for free they use it if they have to pay for it they use it <unk>  how about the long term <unk> in the long term people who got the free bed nets <unk> one year later were offered the option to purchase a bed net at two dollars <unk>  and people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn 't get a free one  so people do not get used to handouts they get used to nets <unk> maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit  so that 's for bed nets so you will think that 's great you know how to immunize kids you know how to give bed nets  but what politicians need is a range of options they need to know out of <unk> all the things i could do what is the best way to achieve my goals <unk>  so suppose your goal is to get kids into school there are so many things you could do you could pay for uniforms <unk> you could eliminate fees <unk> you could build latrines you could give girls sanitary pads etc etc <unk>  so what 's the best well at some level we think all of these things should work <unk> if we think they should work intuitively should we go for them <unk> well in business that 's certainly not the way we would go about it <unk>  consider for example transporting goods  before the canals were invented in britain before the industrial revolution goods used to go on horse carts <unk>  and then canals were built <unk> and with the same horseman and the same horse you could carry ten times as much cargo <unk> so should they have continued <unk> to carry the goods on the horse carts <unk> on the ground that they would eventually get there well if that had been the case there would have been no industrial revolution <unk>  so why shouldn 't we do the same with social policy <unk>  in technology we spend so much time experimenting fine tuning getting the absolute cheapest way to do something so why aren 't we doing that with social policy <unk> what you can do is answer a simple question <unk> suppose you have one hundred dollars to spend on various interventions <unk>  how many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars now i 'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions <unk>  so the first ones are if you want the usual suspects hire teachers <unk> school meals <unk> school uniforms <unk> not bad for your hundred dollars <unk> you get between one and three extra years of education  things that don 't work so well is bribing parents just because so many kids are already going to school that you end up spending a lot of money <unk>  and here are the most surprising results <unk>  tell people the benefits of education <unk>  that 's very cheap to do so for every hundred dollars you spend doing that you get forty extra years of education  and in places where there are worms <unk> intestinal worms <unk> cure the kids of their worms <unk> and for every hundred dollars you get almost thirty extra years of education  so this is not your intuition this is not what people would have gone for <unk> and yet these are the programs that work  we need that kind of information we need more of it <unk> and then we need to guide policy <unk>  so now i started from the big problem and i couldn 't answer it <unk> and i cut it smaller questions <unk> and i have the answer to these smaller questions <unk> and they are good <unk> scientific robust answers  so let 's go back to haiti for a moment  in haiti about two hundred thousand people died actually a bit more by the latest estimate <unk>  and the response of the world was great two billion dollars got pledged just last month <unk> so that 's about ten thousand dollars per death <unk> that doesn 't sound like that much when you think about it <unk>  but if we were willing to spend ten thousand dollars for every child under five who dies that would be ninety billion per year just for that problem <unk>  and yet it doesn 't happen <unk> so why is that well  i think what part of the problem is that in <unk> although the problem is huge <unk> somehow we understand it it 's localized you give your money to doctors without borders you give your money to partners in health and they 'll send in the doctors and they 'll send in the lumber <unk> and they 'll helicopter things out and in  and the problem of poverty is not like that  so first it 's mostly invisible <unk> second it 's huge <unk>  and third we don 't know whether we are doing the right thing there 's no silver bullet <unk> you cannot helicopter people out of poverty <unk> and that 's very frustrating  <unk> we just did today <unk> i gave you three simple answers to three questions <unk>  give lentils to immunize people provide free bed nets <unk> deworm children  with immunization or bed nets you can save a life for three hundred dollars per life saved with deworming you can get an extra year of education for three dollars <unk>  so we cannot eradicate poverty just yet but we can get started and maybe we <unk> get started small with things that we know are effective here 's an example of how this can be powerful <unk> deworming worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines <unk> they are not beautiful and don 't kill anybody <unk>  and yet when the young global leader in davos showed the numbers i gave you they started deworm the world and thanks to deworm the world <unk> and the effort of many country governments and foundations twenty million school aged children got dewormed in two thousand and nine so this evidence is powerful <unk> it can prompt action <unk>  so we should get started now it 's not going to be easy <unk>  it 's a very slow process you have to keep experimenting and sometimes ideology has to be trumped by practicality <unk>  and sometimes what works somewhere doesn 't work elsewhere <unk> so it 's a slow process <unk>  but there is no other way  these economics i 'm proposing it 's like 20th century medicine it 's a slow deliberative process of discovery there is no miracle cure <unk>  but modern medicine is saving millions of lives every year <unk> and we can do the same thing <unk>  and now maybe we can go back to the bigger question that i started with at the beginning <unk> i cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference <unk>  but can we come back here in thirty years and say what we have done <unk> it really prompted a change for the better  i believe we can and i hope we will thank you
