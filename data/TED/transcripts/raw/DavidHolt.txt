with the banjo that he had learned from his mother and grandmother <unk> i fell in love with that i went up to him and said how can i learn that he said well you can go back to clinch mountain where i 'm from or asheville or mount airy north carolina some place that has a lot of music because there 's a lot of old people still living that play that old style <unk> so i went back that very summer <unk> i just fell in love with the culture <unk> i came back to school i finished my degrees and told my parents i wanted to be a banjo player <unk> you can imagine how excited they were <unk> so i thought i would just like to show you some of the pictures i 've taken of some of my mentors just a few of them but maybe you 'll get just a little hint of some of these folks and play a little banjo this this this <unk> those last few pictures were of ray hicks who just passed away last year he was one of the great american folk tale tellers the old jack tales that he had learned he talked like this you could hardly understand him <unk> but it was really wonderful and he lived in that house that his <unk> <unk> had built no running water <unk> no electricity a wonderful wonderful guy <unk> and you can look at more pictures i 've actually got a website that 's got a bunch of photos that i 've done of some of the other folks i didn 't get a chance to show you <unk>  this instrument came up in those pictures it 's called the mouth bow  it is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world and still played in the southern mountains <unk>  now <unk> the old timers didn 't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this they would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up <unk> it was hard on the cats <unk> it made a great little instrument <unk> wide when the yankees saw them coming <unk> were driving in the car outside of gatesville texas where i grew up in the early part of my life outside of gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store my mom was driving my brother and i were in the back seat <unk> we were really mad at my mom we looked out the window <unk> surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields you see we 'd just been to the grocery store and my mom refused to buy us the jar of ovaltine that had the coupon for the captain midnight decoder ring in it  and buddy that made us mad well my mom didn 't put up with much either and she was driving and she said you boys <unk> you think you can have anything you want you don 't know how hard it is to earn money your dad works so hard <unk> you think money grows on trees <unk> brother and i stepped out of the car we were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton there were about a hundred black folks out there picking <unk> my mom grabbed us by the shoulders she marched us out in the field <unk> she went up to the foreman she said i 've got these two little boys never worked a <unk> to that foreman put these two middle class little white boys out in a cotton field in august in texas it 's hot  so he gave us each a cotton sack about ten feet long about that big around and we started picking now  cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers and if you don 't know what you 're doing your hands are bleeding in no time <unk> and my brother and i started <unk> the foreman could see he was in over his head i guess <unk> he kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice he just sang well there 's a long white robe in heaven i know <unk> don want it to leave me behind there 's a <unk> by the end of the day <unk> we 'd each picked about a quarter of a bag <unk> but the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar <unk> but my mother would never let us cash it i 'm fifty seven still have the check  now my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work <unk>  but if you have children you know it doesn 't often work that way no we learned something else the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that <unk> and pretty much never did <unk>  but i also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day and that was an eye opener  and i also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier <unk>  and it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can <unk> boy that day when my mama put me out of the car in that hot texas cotton field i wasn 't even aware of music not even aware of it  but that day in the cotton field out there picking when those people started singing i realized i was in the very heart of real music <unk> and that 's where i 've wanted to be ever since try this old song with me i sing well there 's a long white <unk> chariot 's coming good news chariot 's coming good news <unk> chariot 's coming and i don 't want it to leave me it 's been a while since you <unk> there 's a starry crown in heaven i know <unk> don 't want it to leave me behind good news chariot 's coming <unk> <unk> was a few years ago but i sort of remembered this story and i told it at a concert <unk> my mom was in the audience  after the she was glad to have a story about herself of course but after the concert she came up and she said david i 've got to tell you i set that whole thing up  <unk> i set it up with the foreman i set it up with the owner of the land <unk> i just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work i didn 't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though let 's try good news chariot 's coming good news chariot 's coming good news chariot 's coming and i don 't want it to leave me behind <unk> originally made by the dopyera brothers who later on made the dobro which is a wood bodied instrument with a metal cone for where the sound comes from <unk> 's usually played flat on your lap it was made to play hawaiian music back in the 1920s before they had electric guitars trying to make a loud guitar <unk>  and then african american folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck <unk> just like that a nice merlot works very well <unk> that wine we had yesterday would have been perfect  break it off put it on your finger and slide into the notes <unk>  this instrument pretty much saved my life <unk> fifteen years ago fourteen years ago i guess this year <unk> my wife and i lost our daughter sarah jane in a car accident <unk> and it was the most it almost took me out it almost took me out of this world <unk>  and i think i learned a lot about what happiness was happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief  just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in i had to make lists of reasons to stay alive i had to sit down and make lists because i was ready to go i was ready to check out of this world <unk> and you know at the top of the list of course were jenny and my son zeb my parents i didn 't want to hurt them  but then when i thought about it beyond that it was very simple things <unk> i didn 't care about <unk> have a radio show on public radio riverwalk i didn 't care about that i didn 't care about awards or money or anything nothing <unk> nothing on the list it would be stuff like  seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring <unk> the smell of <unk> catching a wave and bodysurfing the touch of a baby 's hand <unk> the sound of doc watson playing the guitar listening to old records of muddy waters and uncle dave macon and for me the sound of a steel guitar <unk> because one of my parents ' neighbors just gave me one of these things <unk>  and i would sit around with it and i didn 't know how to play it but i would just play stuff as sad as i could play and it was the only instrument that of all the ones that i play that would really make <unk> words no longer say it <unk> let me tell you what i always do i just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar <unk> better just to sink way down in your funky mood <unk> where you want to get but i got some medicine here that just might shake things loose call me in the morning after a dose of these steel <unk> my dad was an inventor <unk> he was working on gyroscopes <unk> he has a number of patents for that kind of thing and we moved across the street from michael and john whitney they were about my age john went on and michael did too to become some of the inventors of computer animation michael 's dad was working on something called the computer this <unk> of vacuum tubes as far as you could see just floors and floors of these things and one of the engineers said some day you 're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket <unk> i thought damn those are going to be some big pants  so that christmas maybe i 've got time for this that christmas i got the mister wizard i wanted to be an inventor just like my dad so did michael his great granddad had been eli whitney the inventor of the cotton gin <unk> so we looked in that this was a commercial chemistry set it had three chemicals we were really surprised to see sulfur potassium nitrate and charcoal  man we were only ten but we knew that made gunpowder <unk> we made up a little batch and and we put it on the driveway and we threw a match and phew it flared up obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon <unk>  so we went over into michael 's garage his dad had all kinds of stuff and we put a pipe in the vice there and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe drilled a hole <unk> <unk> in the back of the pipe took some of our firecrackers pulled out the fuses tied them together put them in the back there  <unk> garage  we weren 't stupid we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it we stood back we lit that thing and they flew out of there they went through that plywood like it was paper  through the garage <unk> two of them landed in the side door of his new citroen  we tore everything down and buried it in <unk> his backyard <unk>  that was pacific palisades it probably is still there back there <unk>  well <unk>  my brother heard that we had made gunpowder he and his buddies they were older and they were pretty mean <unk> they said they were going to beat us up if we didn 't make some gunpowder for them  we said well what are you going to do with it <unk> they said we 're going to melt it down and make <unk> make you a big batch  so we made them a big batch and it was in my now we 'd just moved here we 'd just moved to california mom had redone the kitchen  mom was gone that day we had a pie tin it became chris berquist 's job to do the melting down  michael and i were standing way at the side of the kitchen <unk>  <unk> it just flared up and he turned around and he looked like this  no hair no eyelashes no nothing <unk>  there were big welts all over my mom 's kitchen cabinet the air was the just full of black smoke  she came home she took that chemistry set away and we never saw it again <unk> but we thought of it often because every time she 'd cook tuna surprise it made tasted faintly of gunpowder <unk> so i like to invent things too and i think i 'll close out my set with something i invented a good while back when drum machines were new i got to thinking <unk> why couldn 't you take the oldest form of of music the hambone rhythms and combine it with the newest technology i call this thunderwear at that time drum <unk> and so i put them all together and sewed twelve of them in this suit <unk>  i showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday i 'm going to be doing some of the same ones i have a trigger here <unk> going to really hurt if i don 't take that off okay now <unk> the drum triggers go out my tail here  into the drum machine <unk> and they can make various sounds like drums  so let me put them all together and also i can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right <unk> me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this
