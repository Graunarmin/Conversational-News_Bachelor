 <unk> we see with the eyes <unk> but we see with the brain as well <unk> and seeing with the brain is often called imagination <unk>  and we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination our inscapes we 've lived with them all our lives but there are also hallucinations as well <unk>  and hallucinations are completely different they don 't seem to be of our creation <unk> they don 't seem to be under our control <unk> they seem to come from the outside <unk>  and to mimic perception <unk> so i am going to be talking <unk> and a particular sort of visual hallucination which i see among my patients  a few months ago i got a phone call from a nursing home where i work they told me that one of their residents an old lady in her 90s was seeing things <unk>  and they wondered if she 'd gone <unk> because she was an old lady whether she 'd had a stroke or whether she had alzheimer 's and so they asked me if i would come and see rosalie <unk>  the old lady <unk> i went in to see her <unk> it was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and of good intelligence <unk> but she 'd been very <unk> told me the nurses hadn 't mentioned this that she was blind  that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years <unk> but now for the last few days she 'd been seeing things <unk>  so i said what sort of things and she said  people in eastern dress in drapes walking up and down stairs <unk> a man who turns towards me and smiles <unk> but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth animals too  i see a white building it 's snowing a soft snow i see this horse with a harness <unk> dragging the snow away  then one night <unk> the scene <unk> i see cats and dogs walking towards me <unk> they come to a certain point and then stop  then it changes again <unk> i see a lot of children they are walking up and down stairs <unk> they wear bright colors <unk> rose and blue like eastern dress  sometimes she said <unk> before the people come on she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor which seem to go up to the ceiling <unk> this like a dream and she said no it 's not like a dream it 's like a movie she said it 's got color it 's got motion but it 's completely silent  like a silent movie and she said that it 's a rather boring movie <unk> she said all these people with eastern dress walking up and down very repetitive very limited <unk> it was a hallucination <unk> but she was frightened she 'd lived ninety five years and she 'd never had a hallucination before <unk> she said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing that they seemed to come on by themselves or disappear <unk> she had no control over them she said she didn 't recognize any of the people or places in <unk> hallucinations <unk> and none of the people or the animals well they all seemed oblivious of her <unk>  and she didn 't know what was going on she wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind <unk>  well i examined her carefully she was a bright old lady <unk> perfectly sane she had no medical problems <unk> she wasn 't on any medications which could produce hallucinations <unk> but she was blind <unk>  and i then said to her i think i know what you have i said there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness  this was originally described i said right back in the <unk> 18th century <unk> by a man called charles bonnet <unk> and you have charles bonnet syndrome <unk> nothing wrong with your brain there is nothing wrong with your mind you have charles bonnet syndrome  and she was very relieved at this that there was nothing seriously the matter <unk>  and also rather curious <unk> she said who is this charles bonnet she said did he have them himself  <unk> not crazy i 'm not demented i have charles bonnet syndrome  well <unk> so i did tell the nurses now this for me is a common situation <unk> i work in old age homes <unk> largely i see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired about ten percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations <unk> and about ten percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations <unk> you don 't have to be completely blind only sufficiently impaired  now with the original description in the 18th century charles bonnet did not have them his grandfather had these hallucinations his grandfather was a magistrate <unk> had cataract surgery  his vision was pretty poor <unk>  and in one thousand seven hundred and fifty nine he described to his grandson various things he was seeing  the first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair <unk> it was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles <unk>  and he knew it was a hallucination <unk> you don 't have handkerchiefs in midair <unk> and then he saw a big wheel in midair <unk> but sometimes he wasn 't sure whether he was hallucinating or not  because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions  so on one occasion when his granddaughters were visiting them he said and who are these handsome young men with you  and they said alas grandpapa <unk> there are no handsome young men and then the handsome young men disappeared typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash they don 't usually fade in and out they are rather sudden <unk> and they change suddenly  charles lullin the grandfather saw hundreds of different figures different landscapes of all sorts on one <unk> he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe <unk> and realized it was himself that was the only figure he recognized <unk> on one occasion when he was walking in the streets of paris he saw this was real a scaffolding but when he got back home he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high  on his study table this repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia with him and with rosalie <unk> what seems to be going on and rosalie said what 's going on and i said that as you lose vision as the visual <unk> <unk> parts of the brain are no longer getting any input <unk> they become hyperactive and excitable <unk>  <unk> the things you see can be very complicated indeed <unk> with another patient of mine who also had some vision the vision she had could be disturbing on one occasion she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant and he turned around and then he divided into six figures in striped shirts <unk> who started walking towards her <unk>  and then the six figures came together again like a concertina <unk> once <unk> when she was driving or rather her husband was driving <unk> the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads she had very mobile hallucinations as well <unk>  a lot of them had to do with a car <unk> sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car <unk>  he was very tenacious <unk> and he moved rather gracefully when when the car turned and then when they came to a stop the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff one hundred foot in the air <unk> and then disappear  another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination this was a woman who didn 't have trouble with her eyes <unk> but the visual parts of her brain a little tumor in the occipital cortex and above all she would see cartoons <unk> these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field like a screen and especially she saw cartoons of kermit the frog  <unk> 't watch sesame street <unk> but she made a point of saying why kermit she said kermit the frog means nothing to me <unk> you know i was wondering about freudian determinants <unk> why kermit  kermit the frog means nothing to me she didn 't mind the cartoons too much but what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with rosalie <unk> the faces were often deformed with very <unk> large teeth or very large eyes and these frightened her <unk>  well what is going on with these people as a physician i have to try and define what 's going on  and to reassure people especially to reassure them that they 're not going insane something like ten percent as i said of visually impaired people get these but no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them <unk>  because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something and if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed  in particular the notion is that if you see things or hear things you 're going mad but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different  psychotic hallucinations whether they are visual or vocal <unk> they address you they accuse you they seduce you they humiliate you they jeer at you <unk> you interact with them <unk> there is none of this quality of being addressed with these charles bonnet hallucinations there is a film <unk> you 're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you or that 's how people think about it <unk> there is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy <unk> and sometimes if one has this one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place <unk> in the past you 're at a particular road junction <unk> you smell chestnuts roasting you hear the traffic all the senses are involved  <unk> of feeling <unk> full of familiarity <unk> located in space and time coherent dramatic  the charles bonnet ones are quite different <unk> so in the charles bonnet hallucinations <unk> you have all sorts of levels from the geometrical hallucinations the pink and blue squares the woman had up to quite elaborate hallucinations with <unk> figures and especially faces faces and sometimes deformed faces are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations <unk> and one of the second commonest is cartoons <unk>  so what is going on <unk> fascinatingly in the last few years it 's been possible to do <unk> on people as they are hallucinating <unk> and in fact to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating when people have these simple geometrical hallucinations the primary visual cortex is activated this is the part of the brain which perceives edges and <unk> you don 't form images with your primary visual cortex when images are formed  a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe and in particular one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus <unk>  and it 's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus they maybe lose the ability to recognize <unk> but if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus they may hallucinate faces and this is exactly what you find in some of these people <unk>  there is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented <unk> and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the the deformed <unk> there is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons it 's activated when one recognizes cartoons when one draws cartoons and when one hallucinates them <unk>  it 's very interesting that that should be specific there are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes  <unk> and seventy it was found that there were not only parts of the brain <unk> but particular cells face cells were discovered around one thousand nine hundred and seventy <unk>  and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells which can be very very specific <unk> so you may not only have  car cells you may have aston martin cells  <unk> i saw an aston martin this morning i had to bring it in and now it 's in there somewhere <unk>  laughter now at this level in what 's called the inferotemporal cortex there are only visual images or figments or fragments it 's only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion <unk> and in the charles bonnet syndrome <unk> don 't go to those higher levels you 're in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images <unk> or figments or fragmentary figments all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells <unk>  <unk> and one is not conscious of them <unk> it is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted <unk> and instead of getting normal perception <unk> you 're getting an anarchic <unk>  convulsive stimulation or release of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex so suddenly you see a face suddenly you see a car <unk> suddenly this <unk> this and suddenly that  the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this  but not terribly successfully when these were first described it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams <unk>  but in fact people say i don 't recognize the people i can 't form any <unk> kermit means nothing to me you don 't get anywhere thinking of them as dreams <unk> well <unk> i 've more or less said what i wanted <unk> i think i just i just want to recapitulate and say this is common think of the number of blind people there must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations <unk> but <unk> <unk> are too scared to mention them <unk> so this sort of thing needs to be brought into into notice for patients for doctors for the public finally <unk> i think they are infinitely interesting and valuable <unk> for giving one some insight as to how the brain works  charles bonnet said two hundred and fifty years ago he wondered how thinking these hallucinations how as he put it the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain now <unk> two hundred and fifty years later <unk> i think we 're beginning to glimpse how this is done <unk> thanks very much i was afraid you 'd ask that  yeah a lot of them <unk> and actually i 'm a little visually impaired myself i 'm blind in one eye and not terribly good in the other <unk>  and i i see the geometrical hallucinations <unk> but they stop there ca  and they don 't disturb <unk> well they don 't disturb me any more than my tinnitus <unk> which i ignore <unk> they occasionally interest me and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks <unk> i 've gone and had an fmri myself to see how my visual cortex is taking over  and when i see all these hexagons and complex things which i also have in visual migraine <unk> i wonder whether <unk> everyone sees things like this and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit ca  that was an utterly utterly fascinating talk thank you so much for sharing
