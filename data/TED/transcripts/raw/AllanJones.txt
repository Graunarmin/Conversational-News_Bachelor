 <unk> humans have long held a fascination for the human brain <unk>  we chart it <unk> we 've described it <unk> we 've drawn it <unk> we 've mapped it <unk>  now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by <unk> technology think google maps think gps the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation so let 's take a look at the brain <unk>  most people when they first look at a fresh human brain they say it doesn 't look what you 're typically looking at when someone shows you a brain typically what you 're looking at is a fixed brain <unk> it 's gray <unk> and this outer layer this is the vasculature which is incredible <unk> around a human brain <unk> this is the blood vessels twenty percent of the oxygen coming from your lungs <unk> twenty percent of the blood pumped from your heart is servicing <unk> <unk> this one organ that 's basically if you hold two fists together it 's just slightly larger than the two fists  <unk> going on in the human brain <unk>  so for example they can see in the back part of the brain which is just turning around there there 's the cerebellum that 's keeping you upright right now it 's keeping me standing it 's involved in coordinated movement  <unk> on the side here this is temporal cortex this is the area where primary auditory processing so you 're hearing my words you 're sending it up into higher language processing centers towards the front of the brain is the place in which all <unk> of the more complex thought decision making it 's the last to mature in late adulthood this is where all your decision making processes are going on it 's the place where you 're deciding right now you probably aren 't going to order the steak for dinner <unk>  so if you take a deeper look at the brain one of the things if you look at it in cross section what you can see is that can 't really see a whole lot of structure there <unk> but there 's actually a lot of structure there it 's cells and it 's wires all wired together <unk> so about a hundred years ago some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells <unk> and that 's shown here in the the very light blue you can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained and what you can see is it 's very non uniform you see a lot more structure there <unk> so the outer part of that brain is the neocortex it 's one continuous processing unit if you will <unk> but you can also see things underneath there as well <unk> all of these blank areas are the areas in which the wires are running through they 're probably less cell dense so there 's about <unk> eighty six billion neurons in our brain and as you can see they <unk> <unk> 're very non uniformly distributed and how they 're distributed really contributes to their underlying function and of course as i mentioned before <unk> since we can now start to map brain function we can start to tie these into the individual cells so let 's <unk> take a deeper look let 's look at neurons <unk> so as i mentioned there are eighty six billion neurons there are also these smaller cells as you 'll see these are support cells astrocytes glia  and the nerves themselves are the ones who are receiving input they 're storing it they 're processing it <unk> each neuron is connected via synapses to up to ten thousand other neurons in your brain  and each neuron <unk> itself is largely unique the unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying <unk> <unk> biochemistry these are proteins they 're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement <unk> they 're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with <unk> they 're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do so if we zoom in to an even deeper level  all of those proteins are encoded by our genomes <unk> we each have twenty three pairs of chromosomes we get one from mom one from dad and on these chromosomes <unk> <unk> are roughly twenty five thousand genes they 're encoded in the dna and <unk> thousand genes are turned on and at what level they 're turned on and so our project is seeking to look at this readout understanding which of these twenty five thousand genes is turned on <unk>  so in order to undertake such a project we obviously need brains <unk> so we sent our lab technician out <unk> we were seeking normal human brains what we actually start with is a medical examiner 's office this a place where the dead are brought in <unk> we are seeking normal human brains <unk> there 's a lot of criteria by which we 're selecting these brains we want to make sure that we have normal humans between the ages of twenty to sixty they died a somewhat natural death with no injury to the brain <unk> no drugs on board we do a toxicology workup  and we 're very careful about the brains that we do take we 're also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue we can get consent to take the tissue within twenty four hours of time of death <unk> because what we 're trying to measure the rna which is the readout from our genes is very labile and so so we have to move very <unk> side note on the collection of brains <unk> because of the way that we collect and because we require consent we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains males are much more likely to <unk> <unk> die an accidental death in the prime of their life <unk> and men are much more likely to have their significant other  so the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what 's called an mr this is magnetic resonance imaging <unk> mri <unk> it 's a standard template by which we 're going to hang the rest of this data so we collect this mr and you can think of this as our satellite view for our map the next thing we do is we <unk> <unk> collect what 's called a diffusion tensor imaging this maps the large cabling in the brain and again you can think of this as almost mapping our interstate highways if you will  <unk> and then it 's sliced into one centimeter slices <unk>  and those are frozen solid <unk> and they 're shipped to seattle and in seattle <unk> we take these this is a whole human hemisphere and we put them into what 's basically a glorified meat slicer there 's a blade here that 's going to cut across a section of the tissue and transfer it to a microscope slide we 're going to then apply one of those stains to it <unk> and we scan it and then what we get is our <unk> so this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments you could consider this state boundaries if you will those pretty broad outlines  from this we 're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces  which then we can put on a smaller cryostat <unk> and this is just showing this here this frozen tissue and it 's being cut <unk> this is twenty microns thin so this is about a baby hair 's width and remember it 's frozen and so <unk> you can see here old fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied we take a microscope slide <unk>  then we very carefully melt onto the slide <unk> this will then go onto a robot that 's going to apply one of those stains to it and our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this so again this is what they can see under the microscope you can see collections and configurations of large and small cells in clusters and various places and from there it 's routine <unk> they understand where to make these assignments and they can make basically what 's a reference atlas this is a more detailed map  our scientists then use this to go back to another piece of that tissue and do what 's called laser scanning microdissection <unk> so the technician takes the instructions they scribe along a place there <unk> and then the laser actually cuts <unk> you can see that blue dot there cutting <unk> and that tissue falls off you can see on the microscope slide here that 's what 's happening in real time there 's a container underneath that 's collecting that tissue <unk>  we take that tissue <unk> we purify the rna out of it using some basic technology and then we put a florescent tag on it <unk> we take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray now this may look like a bunch of dots to you but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human <unk> that we spotted down on glass this has roughly sixty thousand elements on it so we repeatedly measure various genes of the twenty five thousand genes in the genome and when we take a <unk> <unk> sample and we hybridize it to it <unk> we get a unique fingerprint if you will <unk> quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample now we do this over and over again this process for any given brain we 're taking over a thousand samples for <unk> each brain <unk> this area shown here is an area called the hippocampus it 's involved in learning and memory and it contributes to about seventy samples of those thousand samples <unk>  so each sample gets us about fifty thousand data points with repeat measurements a thousand samples so roughly we have fifty million data points for a given human brain <unk>  we 've done right now two human brains worth of data we 've put all of that together into one thing and i 'll show you what that synthesis looks like it 's basically a large data set of information that 's all freely available to any scientist around the world they don 't even have to log in to come use this tool <unk> mine this data find interesting things out with this  so here 's the modalities that we put together you 'll start to recognize these things from what we 've collected before here 's the mr it provides the framework there 's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn <unk> it allows you to zoom in <unk> it allows you to highlight individual structures <unk> but most importantly <unk> we 're now mapping into this anatomic framework which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on so the red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree green is the sort of cool areas where it 's <unk> not turned on and each gene gives us a fingerprint and remember that we 've assayed all the twenty five thousand genes in the genome and have all of that data available  so what can scientists learn about this data <unk> we 're just starting to to look at this data ourselves there 's some basic things that you would want to understand two great <unk> prozac and wellbutrin these are commonly prescribed antidepressants now remember we 're assaying genes genes send the instructions to make proteins proteins are <unk> <unk> targets for drugs so drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off etc <unk> so if you want to understand the action of drugs you want to understand how they 're acting in the ways you want them to <unk> and also in the ways you don 't want them to in the side effect profile etc you want to see where those genes are turned on and for the first time <unk> can actually do that we can do that in multiple individuals that we 've assayed too so now we can look throughout the brain we can see this unique fingerprint <unk> and we get confirmation we get confirmation that indeed the gene is turned on for something like prozac in serotonergic <unk> structures things that are already known be affected but we also get to see the whole thing we also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before and we see these genes turned on there <unk> as interesting a side effect as it could be  one other thing you can do with such a thing is you can <unk> because it 's a pattern matching exercise because there 's unique fingerprint <unk> we can actually scan through the entire genome and find <unk> other proteins that show a similar fingerprint <unk> so if you 're in drug discovery for example you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and <unk> optimize <unk>  most of you are probably familiar with genome wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying scientists have recently discovered the gene <unk> <unk> or genes which affect x and so these kinds of studies are routinely published by scientists and they 're great they analyze large populations they look at their entire genomes and they try to find hot spots of activity causally to genes but what you get out of such an exercise is simply a list of genes it tells you the what <unk> but it doesn 't tell you the where <unk> and so it 's very important for those researchers that we 've created this resource now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity they can start to look at common pathways other things that they simply haven 't been able to do before <unk>  so i think this audience in particular can understand the importance of individuality <unk> and i think every human <unk> we all have different genetic backgrounds we all have lived separate lives <unk> but the fact is our genomes are greater than ninety nine percent similar we 're similar at the genetic <unk> and what we 're finding is actually even at the brain biochemical level <unk> we are quite similar <unk> and so this shows it 's not ninety nine percent but it 's roughly ninety percent correspondence <unk> at a reasonable cutoff <unk> so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated <unk> and then we find some outliers some things that lie beyond the cloud and those genes are interesting but they 're very subtle <unk> so i think <unk> though we celebrate all of our differences <unk> we are quite similar even at the brain level <unk>  now what do those differences look like <unk> this is an example of a study that we did to follow up and see what exactly those differences were and they 're quite subtle <unk> these are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type these are two genes that we found <unk> as good examples one is called reln it 's involved in early developmental cues disc1 is a gene that 's deleted in schizophrenia these aren 't schizophrenic individuals <unk> but they do show some population variation <unk> and so what you 're looking at here in donor one and donor four which are the exceptions to the other two that genes <unk> <unk> are being turned on in a very specific subset of cells it 's this dark purple precipitate within the cell that 's telling us a gene is turned on there <unk>  <unk> due to an individual 's genetic background or their experiences <unk> we don 't know those kinds of studies require much larger populations <unk>  so i 'm going to leave you with a final note about the complexity of the brain and how much more we have to go i think these resources are incredibly valuable <unk> they give researchers a handle on where to go but we only looked at a handful <unk> of individuals at this point we 're certainly going to be looking at more i 'll just close by saying that that the the tools are there <unk> and this is truly an unexplored undiscovered continent this is the the new frontier if you will and so for those who are undaunted but humbled by the complexity of the brain the future awaits
