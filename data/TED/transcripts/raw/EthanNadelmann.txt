 <unk> the war on drugs done to the world  look at the murder and mayhem in mexico central america <unk> so many other parts of the planet the global black market estimated at three hundred billion dollars a year <unk> prisons packed in the united states and elsewhere police and military drawn into an unwinnable war that violates basic rights and ordinary citizens just hope they don 't get caught in the crossfire <unk>  and meanwhile more people using more drugs than ever it 's my country 's history with alcohol prohibition and al capone <unk> times fifty  which is why it 's particularly galling to me as an american that <unk> we 've been the driving force behind this global drug war ask why so many countries criminalize drugs they 'd never heard of  why the u n drug treaties emphasize criminalization over health  even why most of the money worldwide for dealing with drug abuse goes not to helping agencies but those that punish and you 'll find <unk> why did we do this  some people especially in latin america think it 's not really about drugs <unk> it 's just a subterfuge for advancing the realpolitik interests of the u s  but by and large <unk> that 's not it  we don 't want gangsters and guerrillas funded with illegal drug money terrorizing and taking <unk> the fact is america really is crazy when it comes to drugs i mean don 't forget we 're the ones who thought that we could prohibit alcohol <unk> so think about our global drug war not as any sort of rational policy  but as the international projection of a domestic psychosis  but here 's the good news now it 's the russians leading the drug war not us most politicians in my country want to roll back the drug war now put fewer people behind bars <unk> not more and i 'm proud to say as an american that we <unk> <unk> now lead the world in reforming marijuana policies <unk> it 's now legal for medical purposes in almost half our fifty states <unk> millions of people can purchase their marijuana their medicine <unk> licensed dispensaries and over half my fellow citizens now say it 's time to legally regulate and tax marijuana more or less like alcohol that 's what colorado and washington are doing and uruguay <unk> and others are sure to follow <unk> so that 's what i do work to end the drug war  i think it all started growing up in a fairly religious moral family <unk> eldest son of a rabbi going off to <unk> university where i smoked some marijuana and i liked it laughter and i liked drinking too but it was obvious that alcohol was really the more dangerous of the two <unk> but my friends and i could get busted for smoking a joint now that hypocrisy kept bugging me <unk> so i wrote my ph d dissertation on international <unk> i talked my way into the state department i got a security clearance i interviewed hundreds of dea and other law enforcement agents all around europe and the americas and i 'd ask them what do you <unk> <unk> think the answer is well in latin america they 'd say to me you can 't really cut off the supply <unk> the answer lies back in the u s in cutting off the demand  <unk> you can 't really cut off the demand the answer lies over there you 've got to cut off the supply  then i 'd go and talk to the guys in customs trying to stop drugs at the borders <unk> and they 'd say you 're not going to stop it here <unk> the answer lies over there in cutting off supply and demand  and it hit me <unk>  everybody involved in this thought the answer lay in that area about which they knew the so that 's when i started reading everything i could about psychoactive drugs the history the science the politics all of it and the more one read the <unk> <unk> more it hit you how a thoughtful enlightened intelligent approach took you over here <unk> whereas the politics and laws of my country were taking you <unk> struck me as this incredible intellectual and moral puzzle <unk> there 's probably never been a drug free society <unk>  virtually every society has ingested psychoactive substances to deal with pain increase our energy socialize even commune with <unk> our desire to alter our consciousness may be as fundamental as our desires for food companionship and sex  so our true challenge is to learn how to live with drugs so they cause the least possible harm and in some cases the greatest possible benefit i 'll tell you something else i learned that the reason some drugs are legal and others not has almost nothing to do with science or health <unk> or or the relative risk of drugs and almost everything to do with who uses and who is perceived to use particular drugs <unk> in the late <unk> 19th century <unk> when most of the drugs that are now illegal were legal the principal consumers of opiates in my country and others were <unk> white women <unk> using them to alleviate aches and pains when few other analgesics were available and nobody <unk> thought about criminalizing it back then because nobody wanted to put grandma behind bars <unk>  but when hundreds of thousands of chinese started showing up in my country <unk> working hard on the railroads and the mines and then kicking back in the evening just like they had in the old country with a few puffs on that opium pipe  that 's when you saw the first drug prohibition laws in california and nevada <unk> driven by racist fears of chinese transforming white women <unk> into opium addicted sex slaves <unk>  the first cocaine prohibition laws similarly prompted by racist fears of black men sniffing that white powder and forgetting their proper place in southern society <unk> <unk> and the first marijuana prohibition laws all about fears of mexican migrants <unk> in so many others as well with both the origins of these laws and their implementation  put it this way <unk> and i exaggerate only slightly <unk>  if the principal smokers of cocaine were affluent older white men and the principal consumers of viagra <unk> cocaine would be easy to get with a prescription from your doctor and selling viagra would get you five to ten years behind bars  i used to be a professor teaching about this now i 'm an activist a human rights activist and what drives <unk> <unk> me is my shame at living in an otherwise great nation that has less than five percent of the world 's population but almost twenty five percent of the world 's incarcerated <unk> population it 's the people i meet who have lost someone they love to <unk> drug related violence or prison or overdose or aids because our drug policies emphasize criminalization <unk> over health it 's good people who have lost their their jobs their homes their freedom <unk> even their children to the state not because they hurt anyone but solely because they chose to use one drug <unk> instead of another  so is legalization the answer  on that i 'm torn <unk> three days a week i think yes three days a week i think no <unk> and on sundays i 'm agnostic but since today is tuesday let me just say that <unk> legally regulating and taxing most of the drugs that are now criminalized would radically reduce the crime violence corruption and black markets and the problems of adulterated <unk> <unk> and unregulated drugs and improve public safety and allow taxpayer resources to be developed to more useful purposes <unk> sugar <unk> and so many other things where there is a demand there will be a supply <unk>  knock out one source and another inevitably emerges people tend to think of prohibition as the ultimate form of regulation when in fact it represents the abdication of regulation with criminals filling the void <unk>  which is why putting criminal laws and police front and center in trying to control a dynamic global commodities market is a recipe for disaster <unk>  and what we really need to do is to bring the underground drug markets as much as possible aboveground and regulate them as intelligently <unk> as we can to minimize both the harms of drugs and the harms of prohibitionist policies  now with marijuana that obviously means legally regulating and taxing it like alcohol <unk> the benefits of doing so are enormous the risks minimal will more people use marijuana maybe <unk>  but it 's not going to be young people because it 's not going to be legalized for them and quite frankly they already have the best access to marijuana <unk> i think it 's going to be older people it 's going to be people in their 40s and <unk> <unk> and 80s who find they prefer a little marijuana to that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill or that it helps with their arthritis or diabetes or maybe helps spice up a long term marriage  and that just might be a net public health benefit as for the other <unk> drugs <unk> look at portugal where nobody goes to jail for possessing drugs and the government 's made a serious commitment to treating addiction as a health issue look at switzerland <unk> <unk> germany the netherlands denmark <unk> england where people who have been addicted to heroin for many years and repeatedly tried to quit and failed can get pharmaceutical heroin and helping services <unk> in medical clinics and the results are in illegal drug abuse and disease and and overdoses and crime and arrests all go down  health and well being improve taxpayers benefit and many drug users even put their addictions behind them  look at new zealand <unk> which recently enacted a law allowing certain recreational drugs to be sold legally provided their <unk> can be legally bought and consumed provided it 's done so within a religious context <unk>  look in bolivia and peru <unk> where all sorts of products made from the coca leaf the source of cocaine are sold legally over the counter with no apparent harm to people 's public health <unk> and so far as we know was no more addictive than coca cola is today conversely think about cigarettes <unk> nothing can both hook you and kill you like cigarettes when researchers ask heroin addicts what 's the toughest drug to quit most say cigarettes <unk> yet in my country and many others  half of all the people who were ever addicted <unk> to cigarettes have quit without anyone being arrested or put in jail or sent to a treatment program by a prosecutor or a judge what did it were <unk> were higher taxes and time and place restrictions on sale and use and effective anti smoking campaigns  probably <unk> but just imagine the drug war nightmare that would result <unk>  so the challenges we face today are twofold <unk> the first is the policy challenge of designing and implementing alternatives to ineffective prohibitionist policies even as we need to get better at regulating and living with the drugs that are now legal  but the second challenge is tougher  because it 's about us <unk>  the obstacles to reform lie not just out there in the power of the prison industrial complex or other vested interests that want to keep things the way they are but within each and every one of us  it 's our <unk> fears and our lack of knowledge and imagination that stands in the way of real reform  and ultimately <unk> i think that boils down to the kids <unk>  and to every parent 's desire to put our baby in a bubble and the fear that somehow drugs will pierce that bubble and put our young ones at risk in fact sometimes it seems like the entire war on drugs gets justified as one great big child protection act which any young person can tell you it 's not  so here 's what i say to teenagers first don 't do drugs <unk> second don 't do <unk> if you do do drugs <unk> there 's some things i want you to know because my bottom line as your parent is come home safely <unk> <unk> at the end of the night and grow up and lead a healthy and good adulthood that 's my drug education mantra <unk> safety first <unk>  <unk> people who believe we need to turn our backs on the failed prohibitions of the past and embrace new drug policies grounded in science <unk> compassion health and human <unk> <unk> rights <unk> where people who come from across the political spectrum and every other spectrum as well where people who love our drugs <unk> people who hate drugs and people who don 't give a damn about drugs <unk> every one of us believes that this war on drugs this backward <unk> heartless disastrous war on drugs <unk> has got to <unk> congrats quite the reaction that was a powerful talk  not quite a complete standing o though <unk> and i 'm guessing that some people here and maybe a few watching online maybe someone knows a teenager or a friend or whatever who got sick maybe died from some drug overdose <unk> i 'm sure you <unk> had these people approach you before what do you say to them ethan nadelmann chris the most amazing thing that 's happened of late is that i 've met a growing number of people who have actually lost a sibling or a child to a drug overdose <unk> and ten years ago those people just wanted to say let 's line up all the drug dealers and shoot them and that will solve it <unk>  and what they 've come to understand is that the drug war did nothing to protect their kids if anything it made it more likely that those kids were put at risk and so they 're now becoming part of this drug policy reform movement  there 's other people who have kids one 's addicted to alcohol the other one 's addicted to cocaine or heroin and they ask themselves the question why does this kid get to take one step at a time and try to get better <unk> and that one 's got to deal with jail and police and criminals all the time so everybody 's understanding the drug war 's not <unk> certainly in the u s you 've got political gridlock on most issues is there any realistic chance of anything actually shifting on this issue in the next five years en i 'd say it 's quite remarkable i 'm getting <unk> <unk> all these calls from journalists now who are saying to me ethan it seems like the only two issues advancing politically in america right now are marijuana law reform and gay marriage <unk>  <unk> to be enacted with majority democratic support so we 've gone from being sort of the third rail the most fearful issue of american politics to becoming one of the most successful
