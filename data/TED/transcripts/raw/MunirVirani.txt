 <unk> i would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals <unk> there are ten thousand species of birds in the world vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds <unk> when you see a vulture like this the first thing that comes to your mind is these are disgusting  ugly <unk>  greedy creatures that are just after your flesh associated with politicians  i want to change that perception i want to change those feelings you have for these birds because they need our sympathy  <unk> and i 'll tell you why first of all why do they have such a bad press  when charles darwin went across the atlantic in one thousand eight hundred and thirty two on the beagle he saw the turkey vulture  and he said these are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity you could not get a worse insult and that from <unk> you know he changed his mind when he came back and i 'll tell you why <unk> they 've also be associated with disney  personified as goofy dumb <unk> stupid characters more recently if you 've been following the kenyan press these are the attributes that they associated the kenyan mps with but i want to challenge that i want to challenge that do you know why <unk> because mps do not keep the environment clean  mps do not help to prevent the spread of diseases <unk> they are hardly monogamous <unk> there 's two types of vultures in this planet there are the new world vultures that are mainly found in the americas like the condors and the caracaras <unk>  and then the old world vultures where we have sixteen species from these sixteen eleven of them are facing a high <unk> risk of extinction <unk>  so why are vultures important <unk>  first of all they provide vital ecological services <unk> they clean up they 're our natural garbage collectors <unk> they clean up carcasses right to the bone <unk>  they help to kill all the bacteria they help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals <unk> studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures <unk>  carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose <unk> and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases  vultures also have tremendous historical significance they have been associated in ancient egyptian culture <unk> nekhbet was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood <unk> and together with the cobra <unk> symbolized the unity between upper and lower egypt in hindu mythology <unk> jatayu was the vulture god <unk> and he risked his life in order to save the goddess sita from the 10 headed demon ravana <unk>  in tibetan culture <unk> they are performing very important sky burials in places like tibet there are no places to bury the dead or wood to cremate them <unk> so these vultures provide a <unk> natural disposal system <unk>  so what is the problem with vultures <unk>  we have eight species of vultures that occur in kenya of which six are highly threatened with extinction  the reason is that they 're getting poisoned and the reason that they 're getting poisoned is because there 's <unk> human wildlife conflicts the pastoral communities <unk> are using this poison to target predators and in return the vultures are falling victim to this  in south asia in countries like india and pakistan four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered  which means they have less than ten or fifteen years to go extinct and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like diclofenac this drug has now been banned for veterinary use in india and they have taken a stand <unk> because there are no vultures there 's been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites and when you have feral dogs you have a huge time bomb of rabies the number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in india  kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in africa <unk> three hundred and fifty three wind turbines are going to be up at lake <unk> i am not against wind energy but we need to work with the governments because wind turbines do this to birds <unk> they slice them in half they are <unk> bird blending machines  in west africa there 's a horrific trade of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market <unk>  so what 's being done well we 're conducting research on these birds <unk> we 're putting transmitters on them we 're trying to determine their basic ecology and see where they go <unk> we can see that they travel different countries so if you focus on a problem locally it 's not going to help you we need to work with governments in regional levels <unk>  we 're working with local communities  we 're talking to them about appreciating vultures about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide <unk> how can you help you can become active <unk> make noise you can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures  volunteer your time to spread the word  spread the word when you walk out of this room <unk> you will be informed about vultures <unk> but speak to your families to your children to your neighbors about vultures <unk> changed his mind
