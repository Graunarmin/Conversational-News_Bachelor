 <unk> like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving adam and eve and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past ten years you know the incident <unk> adam and eve one day in the garden of eden realize they are naked they freak out <unk> and the rest is history <unk>  nowadays adam and eve would probably act differently <unk> about us is being collected by organizations now there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information or big data <unk>  but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy <unk>  and my story is about these tradeoffs <unk> we start with an observation which in my mind has become clearer and clearer in the past few years that any personal information can become sensitive information <unk>  back in the year two thousand about one hundred billion photos were shot worldwide but only a minuscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online in two thousand and ten only on facebook in a single <unk> two point five billion photos were uploaded most of them identified <unk>  in the same span of time computers ' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude  what happens when you combine these technologies together <unk> increasing availability of facial data <unk> improving facial recognizing ability by computers <unk> but also cloud computing which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power which a few years ago was only the domain of three letter agencies <unk> and ubiquitous computing  <unk> which allows my phone which is not a supercomputer to connect to the internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds well to test that we did an experiment on carnegie mellon university campus we asked students who were walking by to participate in a study <unk> and we took a shot with a webcam <unk>  and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop while they were filling out the survey we uploaded their shot to a cloud computing cluster <unk> and we started using a facial recognizer to match that shot to a database of some hundreds of thousands of images which we had downloaded from facebook profiles  by the time the subject reached the last page on the survey the page had been dynamically updated with the ten best matching photos which the recognizer had found  and we asked the subjects to indicate whether he or she found themselves in the photo do you see the subject the computer did and in fact did so for one out of three subjects  so essentially <unk> we can start from an anonymous face <unk> offline or online <unk> and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data <unk>  but a few years back we did something else we started from social media data <unk> we <unk> we ended up predicting social security numbers which in the united states are extremely sensitive information <unk> do you see where i 'm going with this  so if you combine the two studies together then the question becomes can you start from a face and using facial recognition find a name and publicly available <unk> but in fact we even decided to develop an iphone app which uses the phone 's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what i just described to you in real time looking for a match finding public information <unk> to infer sensitive information <unk> and then sending back to the phone so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject an example of augmented reality probably a creepy example of augmented reality in fact <unk>  we didn 't develop the app to make it available just as a proof of concept in fact <unk> take these technologies and push <unk> to their logical extreme imagine a future in which strangers around you will look at you through their google glasses or one day their contact lenses <unk> and use seven or eight data points about you to infer anything else which may be known about you  what will this future without secrets look like and should we care  <unk> we may like to believe that the future with so much wealth of data would be a future with no more biases <unk>  but in fact having so much information doesn 't mean that we will make decisions which are more objective in another experiment <unk> we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate  we included in this information some references to some funny <unk> absolutely legal but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online <unk> now interestingly among our subjects some had posted comparable information <unk> and some had not  which group do you think was more likely to judge harshly our subject paradoxically it was the group who had posted similar information <unk> an example of moral <unk> you may be thinking this does not apply to me because i have nothing to hide but in fact privacy is not about having something negative to hide imagine that you are the h r director of a certain organization and you receive rsums and you decide to find more information about the candidates <unk> therefore you google their names and in a certain universe you <unk> or in a parallel universe you find this information <unk> do you think that you would be equally likely to call either candidate for an interview  if you think so then you are not like the u s employers who are in fact <unk> part of our experiment <unk> meaning we did exactly that we created facebook profiles manipulating traits then we started sending out rsums <unk> and we detected <unk> we monitored whether they were searching for our candidates <unk> and whether they were acting on the information they found on social media and they were discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates <unk>  now marketers like us to believe that all information about us will always be used in a manner which is in our favor <unk> but think again why should that be always the case in a movie which came out a few years ago minority report a famous scene had tom cruise walk in a mall and holographic personalized advertising would appear around him now that movie is set in <unk> <unk> about forty years from now and as exciting as that technology looks it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about <unk> you and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect  so as an example this is another experiment actually we are running not yet completed <unk>  imagine that an organization has access to your list of facebook friends <unk> and through some kind of algorithm they can detect the two friends that you like the most and then they create in real time a facial composite of these two friends now prior to ours have shown that people don 't recognize any longer even themselves in facial composites <unk>  but they react to those composites in a positive manner <unk> so next time you are looking for a certain product and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it it will not be just a standard spokesperson <unk> it will be one of your <unk> and you will not even know that this is happening  now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight  one of these mechanisms is transparency <unk> telling people what you are going to do with their data and in principle that 's a very good thing it 's necessary <unk> but it is not sufficient <unk> transparency can be misdirected you can tell people what you are going to do and then you still nudge them to disclose arbitrary amounts of personal information <unk> so in yet another experiment this one with students  we asked them to provide information about their campus behavior including pretty sensitive questions such as this one <unk> another group of subjects we told them students and faculty will see your answers transparency notification and sure enough this worked in the sense that the first group of subjects were much more likely to disclose than the second it makes sense right  but then we added the misdirection we repeated the experiment with the same two groups this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data <unk> the time we actually started answering the questions <unk>  how long a delay do you think we had to add in order to nullify the inhibitory effect of knowing that faculty would see your answers <unk> ten minutes  five minutes one minute how about fifteen seconds fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups <unk> disclose the same amount of information <unk> as if the second group now no longer cares for faculty reading their answers <unk> now i have to admit that this talk so far may sound exceedingly gloomy <unk>  but that is not my point in fact i want to share with you the fact that there are alternatives the way we are doing things now is not the only way they can done <unk> and certainly not the best way they can be done when someone tells you  people don 't care about privacy consider whether the game has been designed and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy  and coming to the realization that these manipulations occur is already halfway through the process of being able to protect yourself <unk>  when someone tells you that privacy is incompatible with the benefits of big data <unk> consider that in the last <unk> twenty years <unk> researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy preserving manner <unk>  we can browse the internet anonymously <unk> we can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient not even the nsa we can have even <unk> big data while protecting privacy of course  these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects which is why perhaps you don 't hear more about them  which brings me back to the garden of eden there is a second privacy interpretation of the story of the garden of eden which feeling naked and feeling ashamed  you can find echoes of this interpretation in john milton 's paradise lost  in the garden <unk> adam and eve are materially content they 're happy they are satisfied <unk> however they also lack knowledge the moment they eat the aptly named fruit of knowledge <unk> they discover themselves  they become aware they achieve autonomy  the price to pay however is leaving the garden <unk> so privacy <unk> in a way is both the means and the price to pay for freedom again <unk> marketers tell us that big data and social media are not just a paradise of profit for them <unk> but a garden of eden for the rest of us we get free content we get to play angry birds <unk> we get targeted apps <unk> but in fact in a few years organizations will know so much <unk> <unk> about us they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them <unk> and perhaps <unk> there was one english author who anticipated this kind of future where we would trade away our autonomy and freedom for comfort  even more so than george orwell the author is of course <unk> aldous huxley  in brave new world he imagines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coercing <unk> in the book he also offers us a way out of that society <unk> similar to the path that adam and eve had to follow to leave the garden <unk>  in the words of the savage regaining autonomy and freedom is possible although the price to pay is steep so i do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the <unk> control over personal information  the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom rather than a force which will <unk> hiddenly manipulate us <unk>  right now many of us do not even know that the fight is going on but it is whether you like it or not  and at the risk of playing the serpent i will tell you that the tools for the fight are here the awareness of what is going on and in your hands just a few clicks away <unk> thank you
